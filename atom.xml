I tested the LH4830 for weeks in my cramped kitchen to see if a little TV like the LH4830 could still add a lot of value and compared it to other TVs on our list of the best cheap TVs.</p><h2 id="Design-Decidedly-minimalist"><a href="#Design-Decidedly-minimalist" class="headerlink" title="Design: Decidedly minimalist"></a><strong>Design: Decidedly minimalist</strong></h2><p> There is nothing flashy about the LG 24-inch LH4830. Half-inch bezels on three sides of the screen create a clean, modern shape that stops just short of being boxy. Edge to edge panels aren’t an option at this price point, where a costly design would cut into more meaningful additions, like better resolution or speakers.</p><p> The stand takes under a second to attach to the TV, sliding into place with a snap. With a depth of 2.1 inches without the sand, this television is suitable for wall mounting. After testing primarily in the kitchen, I turned it into a second monitor that can be tucked against the wall when not in use or returned to its TV functionality when guests are visiting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nXJoYyubvcUPiVfJUWhITECGHww=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-04-47b70d6fa03e4bc6bd4da8edf6085220.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Use-your-new-TV-in-minutes"><a href="#Setup-Process-Use-your-new-TV-in-minutes" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Use your new TV in minutes"></a><strong>Setup Process: Use your new TV in minutes</strong></h2><p> There are only a few on-screen prompts to follow to set up the LH4830, so it shouldn’t take longer than a minute or two. Scanning for channels takes several minutes, but<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cable-tv-alternatives-save-money-4138322" >cord cutters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be ready to use their TV almost immediately.</p><p> The default screen of the LH4830 is static unless you have cable, which was probably the biggest source of annoyance in all of the testing. Unless you remember to turn the volume down before turning the TV off, you’ll be greeted by the roar of static when you turn the TV on again. An increasing number of people don’t have cable subscriptions at all, so this is a pretty big oversight.</p><h2 id="Interface-LG-webOS-is-clean-and-modern"><a href="#Interface-LG-webOS-is-clean-and-modern" class="headerlink" title="Interface: LG webOS is clean and modern"></a><strong>Interface: LG webOS is clean and modern</strong></h2><p> Android TV is a more universal operating system for smart TVs to use, but I was surprised to find that I preferred<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lg-channel-plus-what-you-need-to-know-4074929" >LG’s webOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Switching between apps is intuitive, and they’re all neatly organized along the bottom of the screen. While testing other televisions I found a lot of instability in the Android operating system, but the LG webOS was stable the entire time. Whether switching between apps or closing apps, we didn’t have any problem with crashing or latency.</p><p> Whether switching between apps or closing apps, we didn’t have any problem with crashing or latency.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123749/7443" target="_top" id="2123749">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123749" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123749/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Perfect-resolution-for-a-small-screen"><a href="#Image-Quality-Perfect-resolution-for-a-small-screen" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Perfect resolution for a small screen"></a><strong>Image Quality: Perfect resolution for a small screen</strong></h2><p> The display of the LH4830 is<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378" >720p <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and that’s all anyone could need at this size. The picture looks perfectly clear, with no significant blurring or smearing. Even during_Avengers: Infinity War_ , a movie with numerous lengthy fight scenes, the TV was able to deliver a fairly crisp picture. The color is just as beautiful on this small model as on LG’s larger televisions, with a rich vibrancy to the green of Gamora’s skin and the dark, beautiful tones of Vormir.</p><p> I was pleasantly surprised by the wide viewing angle of the LG 24LH4830. After only having TVs with VA panels, I expected the same narrow viewing angles that kept me glued to the center of my couch for years. Testing the TV in my kitchen, I had no problem seeing the screen from anywhere in the room. There was no significant loss in color or contrast unless I was practically beside the television. Wherever I was in the cooking or cleanup process, I could look up and spend a few minutes watching “Ozark” without losing details of the dark scenes.</p><p> The LH4830 can be calibrated by a technician with two ISF expert modes, and it has several preset modes that will be plenty for most other users. The Cinema mode was ideal when I tested the TV in my kitchen, with a warm color temperature that is easier on the eyes and looks better in the evening. While cooking, I would turn the picture mode to Game and play rounds of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The Game mode’s latency reduction and motion handling are great for such a budget TV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Quality-Underpowered-speakers"><a href="#Audio-Quality-Underpowered-speakers" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality: Underpowered speakers"></a><strong>Audio Quality: Underpowered speakers</strong></h2><p> The LH4830 has two 5W speakers that do their best to deliver virtual<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/720p-1080i-1080p-explained-3276378" >surround sound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The audio quality is adequate for a TV of this size, but not great. Even with auto volume leveling, soft sounds like whispering are often lost, requiring that the volume be frequently adjusted. Background noise like a dishwasher or air conditioner is going to be enough to drown out the volume of these underpowered speakers. All of that said, I can’t criticize the LH4830 too much. Very few TVs wouldn’t benefit from a dedicated speaker system or soundbar, especially at this price point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BCLpbJ0Nr9vB4BBQjei4aC_jzg8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-02-17f260630f0749ea8529daf9a13c3c01.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><h2 id="Apps-LG-Content-Store-could-use-more-robust-selection"><a href="#Apps-LG-Content-Store-could-use-more-robust-selection" class="headerlink" title="Apps: LG Content Store could use more robust selection"></a><strong>Apps: LG Content Store could use more robust selection</strong></h2><p> After setup, the LH4830 goes automatically to the LG Content Store. The LG Content Store does have apps like Netflix and YouTube, but the selection other than those is seriously limited. Other LG televisions do have access to the Hulu app, so we assume that it will be added to this one in a later update, but if Hulu is a must, then this is not the right choice. As a secondary television, the loss of Hulu isn’t a big deal. The television is compatible with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-devices-to-buy-for-streaming-tv-4061016" >Roku and Apple TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , though, so you can work around the lack of app support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gUelIOzwsKr5o2f2yWumqzKIomI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/3LW4061017-LGElectronics24LH4830-PU24-InchSmartLEDTV2016Model-03-3f829dc8cb05440ea4c8cf67f706694f.jpg"                      alt="LG 24LH4830 Smart TV"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Sandra Stafford</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925549/19272" target="_top" id="1925549">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925549" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925549/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Competitively-priced-for-its-features"><a href="#Price-Competitively-priced-for-its-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Competitively priced for its features"></a><strong>Price: Competitively priced for its features</strong></h2><p> A look at the competition of smart TVs under 24 inches shows that the LH4830 is fairly priced for what it offers. For around $140, it’s a well-made smart TV running on a very stable operating system. The wide-angle panel and small size allow it to be effectively used in a great variety of small spaces, and on a screen this size it doesn’t make sense to pay for much better quality.</p><p> For around $140, it’s a well-made smart TV running on a very stable operating system.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LG-24LH4830-vs-VIZIO-D24F-G1"><a href="#LG-24LH4830-vs-VIZIO-D24F-G1" class="headerlink" title="LG 24LH4830 vs. VIZIO D24F-G1"></a><strong>LG 24LH4830 vs. VIZIO D24F-G1</strong></h2><p> If 720p is too much of a drop in image quality for you, then the VIZIO D series is worth looking at. With specs virtually identical to the LG, this is a decision about which one you are willing to pay for. The VIZIO D24F-G1 (view<a class="link"   href="https://www.vizio.com/en/tv/d-series/D24f-G1?bvstate=pg:2/ct:r=&bvstate=pg:3/ct:r" >online <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) is the same size and perfectly well suited to wall mounting. Last, the VIZIO uses the Android TV operating system.

This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it.

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook. One way is to use the web browser of your pc or Mac, the second is exploring Facebook stories on Facebook Messenger, and the third is by using the Facebook mobile app. We will discuss these three methods below.</p><h3 id="Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser"></a>Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use any of the browsers on your computer and visit Facebook.Log in, and the home page will be displayed.

And on top of the messages, you will see the list of profiles that are currently active, and if any one of them has uploaded a story, their profile will have a blue circle.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on a profile, and the story will be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-messenger.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story via Messenger"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Open-Facebook-Mobile-App-to-View-Stories"><a href="#Method-3-Open-Facebook-Mobile-App-to-View-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Open Facebook Mobile App to View Stories"></a>Method 3: Open Facebook Mobile App to View Stories</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook mobile application.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story. Here’s how to check Facebook story viewers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Facebook account on a browser or launch the mobile app, whichever works for you. And then click on the Your Story option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the viewers’ option that you see towards the bottom left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-who-viewed-facebook-story.jpg"                      alt="View who have seen my Facebok Story"                ></p><p>Now, you can see the list of people’s names who have seen your story.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-2"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-2" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Facebook is a great place to stay connected to people you know, brands, follow celebrities, watch videos, and more. Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see.

The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end.

This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person.

Most people have shifted from the traditional cellular SMS and MMS to online platforms that back up all your chats and make them accessible from multiple devices.</p><p>Facebook is one of the most popular social media websites&#x2F;applications, and now its Facebook Messenger is one of the top messaging apps in the entire world. You can easily send text messages, photos, videos, and voice notes.</p><p>Sometimes due to an issue, Facebook Messenger cannot send videos or photos; that is what you will learn in this article and how to fix those issues.</p><h2 id="Why-Can-Facebook-Messenger-Not-Send-Videos-and-Photos"><a href="#Why-Can-Facebook-Messenger-Not-Send-Videos-and-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Why Can Facebook Messenger Not Send Videos and Photos"></a>Why Can Facebook Messenger Not Send Videos and Photos</h2><h3 id="Reason-1-Network-Problem"><a href="#Reason-1-Network-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Reason 1: Network Problem"></a><strong>Reason 1: Network Problem</strong></h3><p>One of the most common problems is when your messages, photos, or videos are not sent on Facebook Messenger is a network issue. Either your Wi-Fi is not working properly, or there is an issue with your cell carrier. You may have run out of data allowance, or the signals might not be strong enough to upload your videos or photos.</p><h3 id="Reason-2-Phone-Storage-Issue"><a href="#Reason-2-Phone-Storage-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Reason 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Reason 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>Another reason why Facebook messenger is not sending messages could be that your device’s storage is full or its cache memory has reached its maximum and is not registering anything new that is being fed into the application.</p><h3 id="Reason-3-File-Size-Exceeding-Limit"><a href="#Reason-3-File-Size-Exceeding-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Reason 3: File Size Exceeding Limit"></a><strong>Reason 3: File Size Exceeding Limit</strong></h3><p>One of the reasons that may be the cause of the failed photo or video upload can be that the file you are trying to upload exceeds the limits set by Facebook messenger. Messenger allows the size of any media file, photo, or video not to exceed 25 MB. If the size exceeds the limit, Facebook Messenger will show an error.</p><h3 id="Reason-4-Session-Expired"><a href="#Reason-4-Session-Expired" class="headerlink" title="Reason 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Reason 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>Facebook Messenger has a certain time limit after which your login session expires. It will give you a prompt saying the login session has expired. That can also be a reason why Messenger is not sending videos and photos.</p><h3 id="Reason-5-Restricted-Blocked"><a href="#Reason-5-Restricted-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Reason 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked"></a><strong>Reason 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked</strong></h3><p>Suppose your messages have not been delivered, and you see a hollow circle beside your text message or video&#x2F;photo. In that case, there is an unfortunate chance that you may have been restricted or blocked by the recipient while you were sending your message.</p><p>Another chance is that the recipient may have deactivated their account right after you pressed sent, and that is why Messenger may not have delivered your message, photo, or video.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-Messenger-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Messenger-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Messenger on iPhone and Android"></a>How to Fix Messenger on iPhone and Android</h2><p>Here are the fixes to the issues mentioned above. Some fixes may be the same on both iPhone and Android, while others may vary depending upon your device’s operating system.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Network-Settings"><a href="#Fix-1-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Network Settings"></a><strong>Fix 1: Network Settings</strong></h3><p>Please check your Wi-Fi connection, restart your router, and reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. If you are using cellular data, the issue may be that the signals are weak, or your data plan may have expired. Check your data plan or contact your carrier.</p><p>In case of weaker signals, drop down your notification panel and set toggle on your Android or swipe down from the top to open the control center on your iPhone&#x2F;iOS device. Tap the airplane mode&#x2F;flight mode, denoted by a plane symbol. Please turn it on and wait for all connections to be shut off. Then tap it again, and all connections will be turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-1.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-2.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p>Doing this will connect your device to the nearest cell tower and improve signal quality, and your messages, videos, and photos will be sent on Facebook Messenger.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue"><a href="#Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>This is a relatively easy fix in devices using the Android operating system rather than devices with iOS. Go to settings, click on Apps, and scroll down to Messenger. By tapping on Messenger, it will open the App info menu of Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-3.png"                      alt="Click on Apps"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-4.png"                      alt="Click on Messenger App"                ></p><p>The menu will show you different options along with some stats as well. Tap on storage, and you will see the details of how Messenger is using the storage of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-5.png"                      alt="Click on storage"                ></p><p>At the bottom, you will see two main options, clear cache and clear data in this menu. At first, tap on clear cache, and it will clear all the temporary settings and extra data that you do not need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-6.png"                      alt="Clear Cache on Android"                ></p><p>This will hopefully solve the problem. If clearing cache does not help, tap on clear data. Clearing data will delete your account from the device, reset all permissions and settings.</p><p>You will need to sign in to Facebook Messenger again, but do not worry; it will not delete your pictures, videos, or personal data. Try to send any video or photo, and it will surely be effective, and your problem of Messenger not sending videos, photos or messages will be solved.</p><p>However, in iOS, you will have to restart your device by pressing and holding the power button until the power slider appears on the screen. Slide it to turn off your iOS device and wait for it to shut down completely. Power on the device again by pressing and holding the power button. This will clear some cache, but eventually, you might have to delete and reinstall Facebook Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-7.png"                      alt="Go to settings, click on General then click on iPhone storage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-8.png"                      alt="Select the app and Clear cache"                ></p><p>Head down to the settings, General, iPhone storage, and scroll down to Facebook Messenger. After tapping on Messenger, you will see an option to delete the app. Delete it and then open the App Store, from where you can easily reinstall Facebook messenger, and you will be good to go after logging in!</p><h3 id="Fix-3-File-Size-Issue"><a href="#Fix-3-File-Size-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: File Size Issue"></a><strong>Fix 3: File Size Issue</strong></h3><p>Facebook itself allows the uploading of files up to 4 GB. Still, Facebook Messenger is limited to 25 MB, and the reason your videos or photos might not be getting through is that your file size is exceeding Facebook Messenger’s file size limit.</p><p>One fix is that you can send the video or photo by directly sharing it from your file manager or gallery rather than choosing the file from messenger’s inbuilt option. That might not always work.</p><p>An easy solution is that you use any video editing software such as WonderShare Filmora for this job. WonderShare Filmora is a very powerful software with many features that you can use to edit your videos.</p><p>The size issue can be solved by either cropping the video a little bit or simply exporting the video using WonderShare Filmora in a lower quality setting, e.g., If the video is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, you can export it in 1280 x 720 resolution.

Try to send any video or photo, and it will surely be effective, and your problem of Messenger not sending videos, photos or messages will be solved.</p><p>However, in iOS, you will have to restart your device by pressing and holding the power button until the power slider appears on the screen. Slide it to turn off your iOS device and wait for it to shut down completely. Power on the device again by pressing and holding the power button. This will clear some cache, but eventually, you might have to delete and reinstall Facebook Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-7.png"                      alt="Go to settings, click on General then click on iPhone storage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-8.png"                      alt="Select the app and Clear cache"                ></p><p>Head down to the settings, General, iPhone storage, and scroll down to Facebook Messenger.

Still, Facebook Messenger is limited to 25 MB, and the reason your videos or photos might not be getting through is that your file size is exceeding Facebook Messenger’s file size limit.</p><p>One fix is that you can send the video or photo by directly sharing it from your file manager or gallery rather than choosing the file from messenger’s inbuilt option. That might not always work.</p><p>An easy solution is that you use any video editing software such as WonderShare Filmora for this job. WonderShare Filmora is a very powerful software with many features that you can use to edit your videos.</p><p>The size issue can be solved by either cropping the video a little bit or simply exporting the video using WonderShare Filmora in a lower quality setting, e.g., If the video is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, you can export it in 1280 x 720 resolution. This will only affect the quality a little bit but will significantly reduce the size of your video, and it will easily get through Facebook Messenger’s size limit.</p><p>Another unpopular and unconventional fix to this issue is that you can compress the video into a zip file and then send it as a document to the other person or you can also upload it onto Google Drive or any online storage drive and share the link on Facebook Messenger so the other person can easily access the full-sized file in its original quality.</p><h3 id="Fix-4-Session-Expired-2"><a href="#Fix-4-Session-Expired-2" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Fix 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>This is a very simple issue with an even simpler fix.

Then tap it again, and all connections will be turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-1.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-2.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p>Doing this will connect your device to the nearest cell tower and improve signal quality, and your messages, videos, and photos will be sent on Facebook Messenger.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3"><a href="#Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>This is a relatively easy fix in devices using the Android operating system rather than devices with iOS. Go to settings, click on Apps, and scroll down to Messenger. By tapping on Messenger, it will open the App info menu of Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-3.png"                      alt="Click on Apps"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-4.png"                      alt="Click on Messenger App"                ></p><p>The menu will show you different options along with some stats as well. Tap on storage, and you will see the details of how Messenger is using the storage of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-5.png"                      alt="Click on storage"                ></p><p>At the bottom, you will see two main options, clear cache and clear data in this menu. At first, tap on clear cache, and it will clear all the temporary settings and extra data that you do not need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-6.png"                      alt="Clear Cache on Android"                ></p><p>This will hopefully solve the problem. If clearing cache does not help, tap on clear data. Clearing data will delete your account from the device, reset all permissions and settings.</p><p>You will need to sign in to Facebook Messenger again, but do not worry; it will not delete your pictures, videos, or personal data. Try to send any video or photo, and it will surely be effective, and your problem of Messenger not sending videos, photos or messages will be solved.</p><p>However, in iOS, you will have to restart your device by pressing and holding the power button until the power slider appears on the screen. Slide it to turn off your iOS device and wait for it to shut down completely. Power on the device again by pressing and holding the power button. This will clear some cache, but eventually, you might have to delete and reinstall Facebook Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-7.png"                      alt="Go to settings, click on General then click on iPhone storage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-8.png"                      alt="Select the app and Clear cache"                ></p><p>Head down to the settings, General, iPhone storage, and scroll down to Facebook Messenger. After tapping on Messenger, you will see an option to delete the app. Delete it and then open the App Store, from where you can easily reinstall Facebook messenger, and you will be good to go after logging in!</p><h3 id="Fix-3-File-Size-Issue-3"><a href="#Fix-3-File-Size-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: File Size Issue"></a><strong>Fix 3: File Size Issue</strong></h3><p>Facebook itself allows the uploading of files up to 4 GB. Still, Facebook Messenger is limited to 25 MB, and the reason your videos or photos might not be getting through is that your file size is exceeding Facebook Messenger’s file size limit.</p><p>One fix is that you can send the video or photo by directly sharing it from your file manager or gallery rather than choosing the file from messenger’s inbuilt option. That might not always work.</p><p>An easy solution is that you use any video editing software such as WonderShare Filmora for this job. WonderShare Filmora is a very powerful software with many features that you can use to edit your videos.</p><p>The size issue can be solved by either cropping the video a little bit or simply exporting the video using WonderShare Filmora in a lower quality setting, e.g., If the video is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, you can export it in 1280 x 720 resolution. This will only affect the quality a little bit but will significantly reduce the size of your video, and it will easily get through Facebook Messenger’s size limit.</p><p>Another unpopular and unconventional fix to this issue is that you can compress the video into a zip file and then send it as a document to the other person or you can also upload it onto Google Drive or any online storage drive and share the link on Facebook Messenger so the other person can easily access the full-sized file in its original quality.</p><h3 id="Fix-4-Session-Expired-3"><a href="#Fix-4-Session-Expired-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Fix 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>This is a very simple issue with an even simpler fix. If your session has expired, it means that you have been logged in for too long and your hosting servers have timed out. Facebook Messenger will show either ‘Session Expired’ or ‘Session Timed Out’ depending on your software version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-9.png"                      alt="Session Expired Facebook Messenger"                ></p><p>All you have to do is press ‘OK,’ and it will take you to the login screen where you can put in your credentials, and you will be logged in to Facebook Messenger again, and then you can easily send messages, videos, and photos.</p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked-3"><a href="#Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked"></a><strong>Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, there is currently no fix to this issue. If someone has restricted you or blocked you on Facebook or Messenger, you cannot contact them or send them messages. You have to contact them through some other medium or application.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips"></a>Bonus Tips</h2><h3 id="Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android-3"><a href="#Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android"></a><strong>Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android</strong></h3><p>If your text messages are not sent, the most common issue can be a network problem. Either your signals are weak, or if you are using iMessage on iOS or its mirror service on Androids that uses Google Duo, it means that your internet or mobile data is not working.</p><p>To fix the cellular signal issue, you have to toggle on Flight mode until it cuts off all connections and then toggles it off again to regain connectivity. Doing this will connect you to the nearest cellphone tower, and you will get the best possible network coverage. This will also help in providing better cellular data coverage as well.</p><p>For Wi-Fi, either reconnect your phone to a different Wi-Fi network or manually restart your router, and that will hopefully solve the internet issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know all the finicky tips and trips on fixing Facebook Messenger, not sending videos, photos, or messages, nothing can stop you from having a smooth and fun experience. You can now follow these easy fixes and seamlessly share memories with your friends, family, and loved ones in the form of videos, photos, and text messages.</p><p>Now there is no need to worry regardless of what device you have or what operating system it has, iOS or Android; these fixes have got you covered!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/024-approved-dive-into-video-production-mastering-green-screens-on-yt/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Dive Into Video Production Mastering Green Screens on YT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-facebook-fumble-get-unlocked-after-the-hack-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Facebook Fumble?

The ideal length works in a range. This should indicate that there is no such thing. You should experiment with the length of your ad copy. While Facebook has guidelines for its ad copies, they are not a hard and fast rule.</p><p>What works best for your ad copy varies. It depends entirely on your industry, the type of ad you have in place, and the language of the ad copy. You can increase the length of your ad copy to see how customers respond. You can shorten your ad copy to see the response. It would work best if you had a control post in place. This means you create a post with your normal ad copy length. You can use the metrics to see which one wins out. Sometimes, shorter copies are preferred by the customer. You can come across other data points to help you create a better video ad and ad copy.</p><h3 id="Engage-with-Short-Form-Videos"><a href="#Engage-with-Short-Form-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Engage with Short-Form Videos"></a>Engage with Short-Form Videos</h3><p>Short-form video content is taking over the platform.

Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5.

Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8. Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect.

You have the control over enabling or disabling customer reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="Manage Customer Reviews"                ></p><h3 id="10-Include-a-Call-to-Action"><a href="#10-Include-a-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="10. Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page.

That’s not the case with the MaxOak 50000mAh, an absolutely massive and robust charger that attempts to be the jack of all when it comes to charging gadgets on the go. It’s power comes at the cost of massive size and the charging ports aren’t too fast, but if you need tons of power, this is the battery pack to get.</p><h2 id="Design-Bulky-for-travelers"><a href="#Design-Bulky-for-travelers" class="headerlink" title="Design: Bulky for travelers"></a><strong>Design: Bulky for travelers</strong></h2><p> First and foremost, this thing is a tank. At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops. It also measures in at 8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 inches (HWD), making it quite the behemoth to lug around. A small detail regarding the weight of the MaxOak is that it isn’t balanced. The side without the ports holds a fair bit more weight than the side with the various ports. It’s not a significant detail, but one you might notice with time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SHsB9QkFaBbOrU6sw55TzNOqC7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_4Web-5c8ff4adc9e77c0001ff0b36.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> As for the materials, the metal enclosure and place ends give it a fairly solid feel, but the metal doesn’t sit perfectly flush with the plastic ends, at least not in our model. It could be a one-off quality control issue or it might simply be the way in which the charger is constructed, but it’s definitely noticeable.</p><p> The number of ports integrated into the charger is impressive. It includes four<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032" >USB Type-A <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports—two 2.1A and two 1.0A—as well as two AC plug-in style connections—a 12-volt 2.5A plugin and a 20-volt 5.0A plugin. This offers a solid range of options for charging alongside the slew of connection<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-adapter-817585" >adapters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> MaxOak includes with the charger. That said, it would’ve been nice to see a USB Type-C port (or two) considering how ubiquitous they’re becoming.</p><p> At 2.77 pounds, it weighs many times more than most smartphones and nearly as much as most compact laptops.</p><p> Charging the device is done via a small 16.8-volt 2.5A plug-in style port on the opposite side of the power button. Overall, the design is roughly what you’d expect from a 50000mAh laptop battery charger. Yes, it’s heavy, yes it’s quite beefy in size, but it comes with the territory.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around"><a href="#Setup-Process-Simple-to-start-but-yet-another-adapter-to-carry-around" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around"></a><strong>Setup Process: Simple to start, but yet another adapter to carry around</strong></h2><p> Setting up the MaxOak laptop battery charger is as simple as it gets. After removing it from its unbranded cardboard box, it’s simply a matter of plugging it in and getting it charged up completely. Our device came charged at roughly 50% based on the onboard<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-led-stand-for-4153820" >LED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> battery indicator, but to complete our tests we wanted it charged entirely, which leads us to our biggest complaint about this charger.</p><p> The point of a charger is to have extra battery power on hand when needed so you don’t have to carry around unnecessary cables when traveling. Unfortunately, the MaxOak battery pack doesn’t use any kind of USB or standardized port. Rather than charging it with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB Type-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or even a micro-USB port, the MaxOak battery pack relies on its own proprietary power supply that’s nearly as large as most laptop chargers. Sure, the 50000mAh onboard is likely enough that you could leave both the battery pack charger and your laptop charger behind for most events, but eventually you’ll run out of juice and rather than reaching for a cable you would probably already have in your bag, you’re stuck bringing along a proprietary charger.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race"><a href="#Charging-Speed-and-Battery-Slow-and-steady-wins-this-race" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race"></a><strong>Charging Speed and Battery: Slow and steady wins this race</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh manages to charge at a decent rate considering its capacity, but we would’ve liked to see more high-powered ports for speedier charging. We charged and fully drained the MaxOak power bank five times and charging took roughly six to eight hours per recharge with an average of seven hours and fifteen minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FlP4JZUVLoJ3DjKoSRUIFuf1peY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4050506-1_6Web-5c8ff3e6c9e77c0001a926ff.jpg"                      alt="Max Oak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Gannon Burgett</p><p> One nice bonus is the power bank can be charged while also giving a charge to a laptop or mobile device, adding an extra element of convenience.</p><p> Charging the power bank itself is only one half of the equation though—and arguably the less important half. More importantly, is how well it can charge other devices.</p><p> At 50000mAh&#x2F;185Wh, the MaxOak power bank offers one of the highest capacities out there for a device of its size. For mobile devices, we tested it on both a Samsung Galaxy S8 Active as well as an iPhone XS. For laptops, we tested it with an ASUS X555LA notebook.</p><p> The MaxOak power bank charged the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active just shy of twelve times from 0% to 100%. This aligns almost exactly with the 50000mAh capacity of the MaxOak power divided by the 4,000mAh capacity of the Samsung Galaxy S8 Active. We experienced similar results with the iPhone XS. While Apple doesn’t specifically mention the battery capacity of the iPhone XS, third parties have reported it to be approximately 2,700mAh, which would equate to roughly 18.5 full charges. In our tests, we were able to get 17.5 charges from the MaxOak power bank.</p><p> Moving onto laptops, our ASUS X555LA was able to be charged four and a half times from 0% with the MaxOak power bank, with an average charge time of three hours or so. The ASUS X555LA has a relatively small battery compared to most laptops, which means it falls in line with MaxOak’s claims that its power bank can charge a laptop two times over give or take a little.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012415/19272" target="_top" id="2012415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Right-down-the-middle"><a href="#Price-Right-down-the-middle" class="headerlink" title="Price: Right down the middle"></a><strong>Price: Right down the middle</strong></h2><p> The MaxOak 50000mAh power bank comes in at $135.99 at the time of this review.

Considering all three power banks appear to be identical to each other in capacity and accessories, the Renogy looks to be the best value.</p><p> Want to see how other brands compare?

However, it isn’t designed with newer computers and devices in mind. If you have an older laptop on hand that isn’t a MacBook (the MaxOak doesn’t support any MagSafe connectors) or doesn’t use USB Type-C for charging, it’ll get the job done. But if your smartphone or laptop is newer and relies on more recent and powerful connections, you’re going to want to look elsewhere.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jackery-powerbar-battery-pack-review-4589480" >Jackery PowerBar Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/chargetech-27000mah-battery-pack-review-4589409" >ChargeTech 27000mAh Battery Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-powercore-26800-battery-pack-bundle-review-4589459" >Anker PowerCore+ 26800 Battery Pack Bundle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/c/5597632/1622438/14044" target="_top" id="1622438">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14044-1622438" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://oneplusfr.sjv.io/i/5597632/1622438/14044"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  185Wh&#x2F;50000mAh External Battery Power Bank</li><li>Product Brand  MAXOAK</li><li>Price  $135.99</li><li>Release Date  June 2015</li><li>Weight  2.77 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.1 x 5.3 x 1.3 in.</li><li>Color  Gunmetal</li><li>Removable Cables  Yes, included</li><li>Controls  Power button</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs  One DC20V 5A, one DC12V 2.5A, Four USB 5V</li><li>Warranty  One year</li><li>Compatibility  Android, iOS</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-profile-pictures-download-for-free/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Profile Pictures - Download for FREE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-snatch-facebook-videos-and-save-as-mp3s/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Snatch Facebook Videos and Save as MP3s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-exclusive-update-selecting-the-premium-top-10-fb-video-downloading-apps-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exclusive Update Selecting the Premium Top 10 FB Video Downloading Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premiered-compilation-of-high-fidelity-3ds-simulators/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Premiered Compilation of High-Fidelity 3DS Simulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/discover-your-ideal-drawing-tool-chromebooks-finest-list/"><u>Discover Your Ideal Drawing Tool Chromebook's Finest List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/elevate-your-video-presence-with-swiftly-created-captions-and-text-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Video Presence with Swiftly Created Captions and Text on FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/get-clear-shots-again-essential-fixes-for-non-responsive-iphone-camera-focus/"><u>Get Clear Shots Again: Essential Fixes for Non-Responsive iPhone Camera Focus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change GPS Location on Samsung Galaxy F04 Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-fake-gps-location-spoofer-a-good-choice-on-realme-c53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is Fake GPS Location Spoofer a Good Choice On Realme C53? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimized-broadcast-sharing-live-streams-from-twitch/"><u>In 2024, Optimized Broadcast Sharing Live Streams From Twitch</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
