Facebook Live video is a trend"></a>1. Facebook Live video is a trend</h3><p>Since last year, the average time for consuming Facebook Live videos has increased four-fold. Reports from Facebook’s research reveal that video content is consumed five times more than static content by the users.</p><p>Facebook Live has taken things to a new level. As soon as you go live on Facebook, your friends and followers&#x2F;subscribers get notifications automatically.</p><p>Facebook video marketing seems great where you can live interact with your consumers about your products&#x2F;services or a promotional event. You get feedbacks, suggestions for improvements, or outright praise from them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="facebook live video"                ></p><h3 id="2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube"><a href="#2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2.

Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube</h3><p>Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.</p><p>Videos on Facebook perform better than other platforms for video sharing denotes a popular source. Apart from that compared to photo and other graphic posts, videos receive a whopping 135% higher organic search on Facebook.</p><p>Facebook marketing videos are becoming the strongest confidants of business owners nowadays due to these facts.</p><p>The default auto-play feature even makes things lot better, as people stop by to watch at least 5-6 seconds of the video while scrolling down and get hooked to it, without even searching for it.</p><p>The video view counter helps you estimate the way your viral video fared. You can understand users’ behavior to understand their needs and what can you do to bring them to you again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-facebook.JPG"                      alt="upload video to facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short"><a href="#3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep your Facebook video short"></a>3. Keep your Facebook video short</h3><p>Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.</p><p>Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-length.JPG"                      alt="facebook video short"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically"><a href="#4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically" class="headerlink" title="4. Shoot Facebook video vertically"></a>4. Shoot Facebook video vertically</h3><p>A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile. Portrait (vertically-aligned) videos have a better hit rate compared to horizontal shots. Keeping that in mind, make sure to create your new videos in a mobile friendly manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-vertical.JPG"                      alt="facebook vidoe vertical"                ></p><h3 id="5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page"><a href="#5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page" class="headerlink" title="5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page"></a>5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page</h3><p>Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.</p><p>It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.</p><p>You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feature-video-facebook.JPG"                      alt="feature video facebook"                ></p><h3 id="6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail"><a href="#6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully choose thumbnail"></a>6. Carefully choose thumbnail</h3><p>Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.</p><p>When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="facebook thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos"><a href="#7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos"></a>7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos</h3><p>Facebook introduced 360 videos are a rage among the users. Keeping virtual reality in mind, Facebook launched this feature to improve communication and social interaction.</p><p>With a social media video shot with Facebook 360-degree feature, your viewers will connect more with your story and the experience you are sharing. For shooting an event and taking panoramic views 360-videos serve the best result.</p><p>These videos can be rotated, paned, and can be viewed from any angle they desire. They are loved 40 percent more than the traditional videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-360-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook 360 video"                ></p><h3 id="8-Mobile-friendly"><a href="#8-Mobile-friendly" class="headerlink" title="8. Mobile friendly"></a>8. Mobile friendly</h3><p>Being the perfect partner to kill time, while waiting for someone, travelling alone, or in the queue in a supermarket, mobile phones certainly have more attention than other gadgets.</p><p>So, Facebook marketing videos need to cash on this aspect. These videos need to be mobile-friendly, means they have to be short and aligned to fit any mobile screen size without pixellating. Adverts that scored high for mobiles have the following aspects –</p><ul><li>Easy to understandable message, even without any audio.</li><li>Most part of the video concentrates on the product or service.</li><li>The visuals identify the brand clearly</li><li>Voiceover supports the visuals.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobile-users.JPG"                      alt="mobile friendly"                ></p><h3 id="9-Posting-time-is-important"><a href="#9-Posting-time-is-important" class="headerlink" title="9. Posting time is important"></a>9. Posting time is important</h3><p>Knowing the right time to post your social media video on Facebook or any other social media platform is vital.</p><p>People from diverse backgrounds or field of work consume different video content. You might have heard that Wednesdays are great for business related videos.</p><p>There are tools to study the statistics and analyze the most favorable time for posting your Facebook marketing video. You can use them to determine what’s your time to post and get more viewership.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Add-call-to-action"><a href="#10-Add-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="10. Add call to action"></a>10. Add call to action</h3><p>Adding a call to action in your video is vital.

Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear.

To do that, follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook page and log in using your Facebook credentials. Please remember that this feature is only available for smartphones and iPad.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your profile page and locate the Music tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the Music option.

And it’s pretty apparent that after adding a song to your profile picture, you will like to hear it out as well. So, here’s how you can listen to the added song.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your Facebook profile on your smartphone or tab and go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once again, go to the Music option and click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see all songs that you have added to your profile.

For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile-3"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that.

Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator made a good showing when we tested it. It gets high marks for accuracy, portability, and convenience, but it does fall down in some areas such as storing the air hose and power cable. Nevertheless, it’s a handy, nifty device that delivers the air you need when you need it.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility"></a><strong>Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility</strong></h2><p> The form factor of the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a case study in maximum portability. It weighs a mere 5 pounds, and the sturdy handle makes it easy to pick up and move around. Moreover, at 11.8 inches long, 4.3 inches wide and 6.7 inches tall, it’s quite compact. And it’s hard plastic casing means it can withstand some punishment and still deliver top performance.</p><p> Unlike other portable air compressors that draw their power from your car’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V socket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cigarette lighter) or directly from the battery, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator gives you the option of connecting it to a standard wall outlet. This makes it a very nice item to have in your garage or basement for the occasion where you have to fill up items such as sporting equipment, party balloons, and inflatable swimming pools.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >digital LCD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump. It’s nice, bright, and can be read both in direct sunlight and on dark nights. It displays pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), BAR (atmospheric pressure), and kPA (kilopascal). If you’re going to use this pump mainly with American cars, you might never use units other than PSI, but it’s very convenient if you ever need to measure pressure in metric or SI (International System of Units).</p><p> The digital LCD is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump.</p><p> The maximum PSI of this portable tire inflator is 90 PSI. This is more than enough to inflate your car tires, sports equipment, and anything else you need. Most car and truck tires have a recommended PSI between 30 and 32 PSI. The Kensun will get the job done, but other car air compressors we tested can reach a maximum of up to 150 PSI.</p><p> This car tire inflator only has a 21-inch air-hose. So you’ll need to place it less than two feet away from the tire you want to inflate. The 10.9-foot power cord gives you some range, but a good deal of it will be running from your dashboard and out your car window. This is about the same hose length you can expect similar products, but it pales in comparison to the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which has a 16-foot air hose.</p><p> The integrated flashlight on the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is pretty bright and illuminates the pump’s working area well. This also makes it more visible to passing cars if you happened to be filling up on the side of the road late at night.</p><p> One of the more annoying aspects of this portable air compressor is how it stores its cords while not in use. Both the air-hose and 12V adapter cord share one big compartment in the bottom of the pump. This would be fine if there was a clear way to fit them in there. When we received our test unit, we were surprised to see that it looked like the power cord was jammed in with no cable management at all.</p><p> When you do finally get it wrapped up, the pump fits nicely in its included carrying case. It’s made of gore-tex, a fairly durable material, so it can take the punishment of being stored long-term in your trunk, and it’s compact enough that it won’t take up much room.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016143/19272" target="_top" id="2016143">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016143" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016143/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute"><a href="#Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: T-minus one minute"></a><strong>Setup Process: T-minus one minute</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve read the user manual, you’ll know how to use the Kensun portable tire inflator. Nevertheless, you’ll want to do some test runs before you take it on the road. During our testing phase, we timed how long it takes from getting out of the car to the pump inflating one of our tires. It took about one minute, which is good time if you’re on the side of the highway with an unexpected flat.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud</strong></h2><p> When we tested the tire inflator, we took it on a road trip that took us to the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Along the way, we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations. In order to use them in the circumstances, they were designed for. Throughout it all, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator never failed to work when we needed it.</p><p> We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> We deflated all four tires on our 2014 Kia Rio to 20 PSI—the recommended PSI for that model is 32 PSI, meaning 20 PSI was dangerously low to drive on. We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> This is a bit longer than the average fill time of the other models we tested like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor pump, which consistently filled our tires in under a minute.</p><p> Any portable tire inflator you use will generate a good deal of noise. Using a decibel meter, we measured how loud this compressor gets while it’s in use. The highest level we recorded was 90 decibels, but it usually hovered at about 88 decibels. That’s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but you’ll have to step away if you want to take a phone call.</p><p> The accuracy was the best of all the air compressors we tested. We compared the air pressure on the digital display with that of a plain pencil-style tire pressure gauge. We found that it was consistently accurate to within a 5 PSI range. Four times more accurate than the 2 PSI range we observed on some other inflators.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long. However, if you’re using it to inflate multiple objects or larger items, you’ll have to take a periodic break while it cools down.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long.</p><p> One of the most convenient things about this portable air pump is its auto-shutdown feature. This allows you to select the precise tire pressure you want before you start pumping. Once the tire is inflated to the desired pressure, it shuts down. This means that you don’t have to babysit the pump while it’s going, and all but guarantees that you won’t over-inflate your tires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility"><a href="#Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility" class="headerlink" title="Price: A decent buy considering its versatility"></a><strong>Price: A decent buy considering its versatility</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator has an MSRP of $80 on Amazon, which is a good price for what you get. It’s not nearly as affordable as some budget models we’ve seen, such as the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump, which will only run you $40, but it gives you the convenience of not having to be tethered to your car to inflate something.</p><h2 id="Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is similar to the Jaco Digital Tire Inflator, they have similar cord and hose lengths, and can continually run for about half an hour. But the Kensun is more than twice the size of the Jaco, so it can deliver more power to fill your tires faster. Additionally, the Jaco lacks the ability to plug into an AC socket, so you can only use it in your car.</p><p> But the Jaco does offer some benefits the Kensun doesn’t. Its built-in light is just as bright as the Kensun’s, but it also has the ability to flash hazard signals for oncoming traffic, and even put out an SOS in Morse Code in the event of real emergencies. Plus, its small form factor makes it much easier to put away and store.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A portable tire inflator that can work well in a car or at home.</strong></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a great choice to keep in your truck, garage, or wherever you keep your “just-in-case” supplies. It’s a device that is as necessary for drivers as jumper cables and an emergency flashlight. You can count on it to be reliable when you need it, and fill your tires quickly and accurately. Plus, the added benefit of being able to plug it into your wall can’t be overstated. It has its foibles, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re minor inconveniences.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  AC&#x2F;DC Portable Air Pump Tire Inflator</li><li>Product Brand  Kensun</li><li>Price  $79.99</li><li>Release Date  July 2016</li><li>Weight  5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.8 x 4.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 Years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-superior-ff-videograbber-package-easy-and-reliable/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Superior FF Videograbber Package - Easy and Reliable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-streamline-your-internet-use-with-these-5-chromium-addons-for-vids-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streamline Your Internet Use With These 5 Chromium Addons for Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-financial-gains-from-social-video-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Financial Gains From Social Video Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-top-10-fb-videos-to-mp4-converter-toolkit-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 10 FB Videos to MP4 Converter Toolkit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-friendly-frenemies-top-social-vr-games/"><u>[Updated] Friendly Frenemies Top Social VR Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-merging-youtube-soundtracks-to-cinematic-scenes/"><u>[Updated] Merging YouTube Soundtracks to Cinematic Scenes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-splitcam-breakdown-best-or-not-amongst-recorders/"><u>2024 Approved SplitCam Breakdown Best or Not Amongst Recorders?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-visual-vault-techniques-for-capturing-tweets-animated-content/"><u>2024 Approved The Visual Vault Techniques for Capturing Tweets’ Animated Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/bridging-the-time-gap-in-social-storytelling-on-fb-pcmobile-for-2024/"><u>Bridging the Time Gap in Social Storytelling on FB, PC/Mobile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-the-two-factor-authentication-on-iphone-12-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Remove the Two Factor Authentication On iPhone 12 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-iphone-12-to-other-iphone-15-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer WhatsApp From iPhone 12 to other iPhone 15 devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-6-appsservices-to-trace-any-vivo-t2-5g-location-by-mobile-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 6 Apps/Services to Trace Any Vivo T2 5G Location By Mobile Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/streamlined-signal-synchronizer-for-podcasters/"><u>Streamlined Signal Synchronizer For Podcasters</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches bring a bounty of functionality to the table—and right to your wrist. But these devices also tend to cast a wider net that includes fitness tracking among many other tools like listening to music or responding to email. If focusing on workouts and general wellness is your priority, you may be interested in scaling back from a full-blown<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a full-time fitness tracker like the Samsung Galaxy Fit.</p><p> This new addition to the Samsung wearable lineup carries over many of the hallmarks of smartwatches offered by the brand, but in a much slimmer profile and a more targeted and accurate focus on fitness.</p><p> We tested the Samsung Galaxy Fit on its ability to track workouts and how comfortable it is as a 24&#x2F;7 accessory.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Tf5FJJb3h1iBWaZIkx-ZF7NeOTg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-6-b9990e3655e34e2ca712150225748ab6.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885947/19272" target="_top" id="1885947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated"><a href="#Design-Functional-and-slightly-elevated" class="headerlink" title="Design: Functional and slightly elevated"></a><strong>Design: Functional and slightly elevated</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit is a fitness-oriented device, and the design reflects this. It’s clean, minimal, and straightforward. Not only is this wearable extremely lightweight at only 0.81 ounces, but it’s also quite slim, which gives it a bracelet-like appearance.</p><p> There’s only one button to interact with, and it’s located on the left side of the watch and is responsive and straightforward to use. The strap is made of durable rubber and includes plenty of notches for a close fit. While the band is more focused on ruggedness and skews more toward the typical fitness watch aesthetic, the screen gives the device a more refined appearance.</p><p> The face is long and narrow and features a crisp, full-color AMOLED 120 x 240 display. This bright display is pleasing to the eye, but the scroll interaction is somewhat awkward given the size of the screen. A very light touch is necessary, and even then, it may take some time to get used to scrolling on such a narrow surface area.</p><p> We found the quick-access menu particularly difficult to maneuver. A swipe down from the top of the screen reveals it, but swiping to the right to toggle through all the options often just closed the menu altogether.</p><p> While this watch is diminutive in size, it can withstand the wear and tear that comes with biking, swimming, and other activities. The device as a whole is rugged and heavy-duty enough to withstand 50 meters of water as well as a drop or two, according to the MIL-STD-810G durability rating.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/uFwssrqnoTWtrPSlF6y16TFjA5A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-2-2e9d9cba7ec342918320509e630b0f09.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106655/12108" target="_top" id="2106655">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106655" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106655/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point"><a href="#Setup-Process-Speedy-and-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process :Speedy and to the point"></a><strong>Setup Process</strong> :<strong>Speedy and to the point</strong></h2><p> Other than the watch itself, the only other equipment is a wireless charging dock. Charging to 100 percent is recommended at setup, and it took us about 40 minutes for the device to charge in full from about 70 percent charged out of the box.</p><p> After that, we downloaded the compatible app for the device, called Galaxy Fit. We were able to pair the device in just a few seconds. We also had to download the Samsung Health app in order to access our activity data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/E_Ki7o6LChwW9AdtjDKL2L1lHjw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-4-abd906dedc9c440188c23a5aabdfebe0.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comfort-Almost-undetectable"><a href="#Comfort-Almost-undetectable" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: Almost undetectable"></a><strong>Comfort: Almost undetectable</strong></h2><p> Like the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4174640" >Samsung Galaxy Watch Active <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , this device also features a tucked-in strap. The difference is that there’s a little pin with a round head instead of the straight pin that most watch buckles have. This detail makes for an extremely close fit that verges on almost too close.</p><p> The combination of such a close fit and little surface area made it a somewhat awkward to put on and take off the device—it was easier to ask for a second pair of hands to help nudge the strap out from underneath the band than wrestle with it alone.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, it was generally undetectable for most of the day, including while sleeping. When we did notice it, it was because it felt too snug, which was often the case by the end of day. Adjusting the fit for a looser feel left gapping in the band.</p><p> While the fit can be tight, its generally undetectable for most of the day—including while sleeping.</p><p> A little more surface area on the band and additional notches could be helpful for a more middle-of-the-line fit—what felt fine in the morning often felt way too tight by the end of the day.</p><p> So while it was mostly comfortable for general wear and during exercise activities, we found that the fit suffered from being either too tight or too loose because the adjustments weren’t incremental enough. It was hard to find a just-right middle ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SRdpyMKwwNLE2m_Dnn2o9thnpQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-3-40a8d98ca4a04e7c9b5b18531df43e6f.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy"><a href="#Performance-High-marks-for-accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Performance: High marks for accuracy"></a><strong>Performance: High marks for accuracy</strong></h2><p> Since fitness tracking is really the name of the game for this device, we had high hopes that it would perform well. We weren’t disappointed by what we found. We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> On a walk, steps logged were in line with a Garmin watch we use to track activity, and so was running. The running data was particularly impressive to see stacked up against the running-focused Garmin watch. Even without initiating a run workout, mileage, time elapsed, pace, and cadence were all within very close range. The Garmin edged out the Galaxy Fit with heart rate and cadence details throughout the run instead of just an overall summary. But all in all, the accuracy was really quite spot on.</p><p> We were pleased with its ability to automatically track running, swimming, and sleep activities.</p><p> Samsung says that swimming is automatically detected by the watch and water lock mode will initiate on its own, and we found that to be spot on when we took this watch along for laps in the pool. The results compiled in the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072" >Samsung Health <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app after the workout were also surprisingly detailed. We were able to see the strokes we’d performed and our corresponding pace, our stroke rate, overall distance covered, and something called SWOLF, which is a way to measure stroke efficiency.</p><p> One downside we noticed is that the Fit did not capture mileage for cycling workouts. While it did accurately and automatically track the time elapsed, there was little detail beyond that. The only way to track miles, pace, and speed was to launch a cycling workout through the Samsung Health app.</p><p> All activity data, including information on sleep quality and patterns, is laid out clearly in the supplementary Samsung Health app, which is particularly useful for viewing a week’s worth of activity data. It’s really the only way to see beyond the most recent activity or two, which is all the watch will show you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/APk5ikkGQieSTN39gBAQ6rf6H9E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/04LW4161013-5-5ff5a7cfa0c34594b8d74bbb224e9800.jpg"                      alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Yoona Wagener</p><h2 id="Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use"><a href="#Battery-Good-for-a-full-week-of-use" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Good for a full week of use"></a><strong>Battery: Good for a full week of use</strong></h2><p> Samsung says this watch is good for up to seven to eight days with regular activity and use, and up to eleven days with minimal use. We found that this watch lasted on the initial charge for a full<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/fitness-trackers-with-the-best-battery-life-4077272" >eight days <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which lined up with the manufacturer claims. It’s hard to say how the battery life would stack up to multiple workouts in a day—we typically only did one a day over the course of a week, but our experience with the device supports the strong battery life claims.</p><p> When we did have to charge the device again, we found that process to be speedy: it took only two hours to recharge in full.</p><h2 id="Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app"><a href="#Software-Dial-up-your-fitness-with-the-Samsung-Health-app" class="headerlink" title="Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app"></a><strong>Software: Dial up your fitness with the Samsung Health app</strong></h2><p> Unlike other Samsung smartwatches, the Samsung Galaxy Fit is built on a FreeRTOS (real time operation software) platform. This OS relies heavily on the companion smartphone app and the Samsung Health app for a well-rounded experience.</p><p> Most of the settings for notifications and even choosing quick, pre-written responses to texts can be set up through the mobile app. You can also choose watch faces to personalize the style of your Galaxy Fit—there’s a specific screen inside the app that details all the design options and allows you to change the look whenever you want.</p><p> In addition to controlling the watch settings easily from the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-apps-1616114" >mobile app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the Samsung Health app is the other go-to resource. Here you can view all the information captured by the activity tracker, including fitness, sleep, and even stress levels. You can also take this a step further by using the app to monitor calories, weight, and water intake.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Great-for-what-you-get"><a href="#Price-Great-for-what-you-get" class="headerlink" title="Price: Great for what you get"></a><strong>Price: Great for what you get</strong></h2><p> The Samsung Galaxy Fit retails for $99.99, which makes it a strong competitor in the fitness tracker market. Similarly-priced devices from the Fitbit brand offer an equivalent bundle of all-day activity tracking and general wellness features but lack the vibrant display of the Galaxy Fit.</p><p> There are cheaper options out there, too, like the Garmin vívofit 4, which sells for between $60 and $80. But it lacks a heart rate monitor or the smart capabilities of the Fit, like canned text-messaging responses and the ability to send calls straight to voicemail. For the activity tracking and smart device functionality, the Fit is a fair price and maybe even a bargain for some.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR"><a href="#Samsung-Galaxy-Fit-vs-Fitbit-Inspire-HR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR"></a><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fit vs. Fitbit Inspire HR</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is a close competitor to the Samsung Galaxy Fit. Both are priced at just below $100 and have many of the same wellness and activity tracking features. Both are water resistant up to 50 meters, track active and resting heart rate, feature sport profiles, log sleeping activity, and integrate various types of notifications.</p><p> But the Galaxy Fit offers wireless charging and a full-color display, while the Fitbit Inspire HR comes with a charging cable and sports a grayscale<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display. The Fitbit also only has a five-day battery life versus the maximum eleven-day battery life on the Fit. But the FitBit Inspire HR also comes with some tools that the Fit lacks, like a timer and stopwatch and menstrual tracking.</p><p> Not quite sure if a fitness tracker or smartwatch is for you?

You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.  * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.</code></pre><h2 id="Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification-3"><a href="#Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification"></a>Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification</h2><h3 id="1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information-3"><a href="#1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Although <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> is different kind of scam, such types are more confusing and irritating to counter. Urgent personal messages have been an effective form of viruses fraudsters have used to gain personal information from Facebook messages.</p><p>This form of the virus has turned out to be a conventional virus type; however, only a single download was what could breach your personal information. Your account would be breached over a single click, and you’ll be countering a problem that might never get easy on you.</p><h3 id="Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses"><a href="#Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Video Scam Viruses"></a>Facebook Video Scam Viruses</h3><p><strong>Facebook video scam</strong> has been at the forefront of viruses, where it has breached a lot of users’ privacy with its simple yet effective technique of gaining personal information. Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.</p><p>Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file.

There is a need to look into the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and dissect all the possibilities that associate the situation and the possibilities it brings for the hackers behind it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-2.jpg"                      alt="is that you fb scam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148638/16836" target="_top" id="2148638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148638/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message"><a href="#What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message" class="headerlink" title="What Happens After You Click the Link or Message"></a>What Happens After You Click the Link or Message</h3><p>This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams. Users are tricked into giving their confidential credit card details, leading to monetary threats and scams. It has been reported that users have potentially lost money due to this mistake of letting hackers go into the account.</p><p>The developers of these viruses have an objective of personal gains out of these kinds of viruses, which can be quite a botheration for the users. The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</h2><p>Considering you have been victim to such a <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> virus, or you wish to take preventive measures to save yourselves from such problems, there are a set of different techniques which should be followed to make your life free from such deceptive and destructive viruses. Look into the following discussion in this part to understand what you should do before or after you face such issues within your profile.</p><h3 id="Use-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#Use-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="Use Two-Factor Authentication"></a>Use Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>One of the most effective systems to protect your account is to use 2FA across your account. This acts as a roadblock to cybercriminals, which prevents hackers from accessing your account and accessing the passwords.</p><h3 id="Password-Managers"><a href="#Password-Managers" class="headerlink" title="Password Managers"></a>Password Managers</h3><p>There are many ways that a password manager can be a convenient form to protect your accounts from being hacked. Password managers use techniques that change the credentials of your account for every site or get passwords that are random and cannot be guessed. The use of these managers is quite swift and makes it harder for hackers to break through it.</p><h3 id="Anti-Viruses-with-Built-In-Web-Filters"><a href="#Anti-Viruses-with-Built-In-Web-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Anti-Viruses with Built-In Web Filters"></a>Anti-Viruses with Built-In Web Filters</h3><p>People can get tricked into having their accounts breached with such malware; however, the use of proper software can get you safely from the threats they pose. It is advised to use anti-viruses containing web filters so that URLs with malicious content cannot be accessed; thus, protecting your account integrity.</p><h3 id="Let-Your-Friends-Know"><a href="#Let-Your-Friends-Know" class="headerlink" title="Let Your Friends Know"></a>Let Your Friends Know</h3><p>If you think your account has been breached, you should take up a different channel to let your friends know of the problem. This would potentially help you ensure that nothing problematic occurs within your profile that would set problems for you.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has described all the potential explanations associated with the <strong>“It’s You In this Video” Facebook message</strong>.

Although, a few put their profile at risk for winning a chance in the “online lottery.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?"></a>Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?</h2><p>The main idea of the “Is That You” Facebook video virus is to breach the users’ privacy and take in potential information that would effectively harm the image or the profile security. There is a need to look into the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and dissect all the possibilities that associate the situation and the possibilities it brings for the hackers behind it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-2.jpg"                      alt="is that you fb scam"                ></p><h3 id="What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message-3"><a href="#What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message-3" class="headerlink" title="What Happens After You Click the Link or Message"></a>What Happens After You Click the Link or Message</h3><p>This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148771/18498" target="_top" id="2148771">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148771" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="350" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148771/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams.
