Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip!

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming. These are the steps you need to take to clear the browser cache.</p><p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong></p><ol><li>Open chrome. Look for three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the browser. Click on that.</li><li>Select ‘More tools’</li><li>Tap on ‘Clear browsing data’ or press Ctrl+Shift+Del keys simultaneously.</li><li>Choose the time range you want the browser history cleared. Select ‘All time’ for a full wipe.</li><li>Click on ‘Cached images and files’ along with other options.</li><li>Click ‘Clear data.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-7.png"                      alt="clear browsing data on google chrome"                ></p><h3 id="Method-5-Disable-Adblock"><a href="#Method-5-Disable-Adblock" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Disable Adblock"></a>Method 5: Disable Adblock</h3><p>One way to prevent your live streams from getting disrupted is to disable your Adblock. There are options within the browser extension that you can use. There is also a carte-blanche option. This works for all ad-blockers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on ‘Manage Add-ons’</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select ‘Toolbars and Extensions’</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right-click your ad-block and tap on the ‘Disable’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-8.png"                      alt="disable extension to stop live stream interruptions"                ></p><p>Those were the steps you need to take to fix any Facebook live video problems.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections-3"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline "                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end.

This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person.

So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option.

The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option.

So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only.

This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it.

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline "                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe-2"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them-2"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-2"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option.

Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[ 4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [ 4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode-3"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline "                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe-3"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them-3"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-3"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story. Here’s how to check Facebook story viewers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Facebook account on a browser or launch the mobile app, whichever works for you. And then click on the Your Story option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the viewers’ option that you see towards the bottom left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-who-viewed-facebook-story.jpg"                      alt="View who have seen my Facebok Story  "                ></p><p>Now, you can see the list of people’s names who have seen your story.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img

What are the Differences Between Facebook Story and Facebook Feed?</h3><p>Facebook offers two options for users to share their views, pictures, and videos, the News Feed, and Stories. However, many people are confused and wonder about the difference between the two.</p><p>News Feed is the core functionality of Facebook and has been a part of it since the beginning. When you post an update here using the “What’s on your mind” box, it appears on your wall&#x2F;timeline. To find new content, you need o scroll down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-post-feed.jpg"                      alt="How Facebook Feed Posts Look Like "                ></p><p>On the other hand, Stories is a feature introduced a few years ago.

With more than 4.17 billion video views, the melody of Shape of You used the pentatonic scale, which is one of the most popular ones of the lot. It is considered the happy song that showcases the story of an athletic couple in the magical 4 minutes.</p><p>The Shape of You displays a solid female empowerment message as a compelling love story. The song was released in January 2017.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-facebook-music-videos-2.jpg"                      alt="shape of you"                ></p><h3 id="See-You-Again"><a href="#See-You-Again" class="headerlink" title="See You Again"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=391484668023960&external_log_id=9be25a2a-8b76-4aa0-8e32-245f64dfba0d&q=see%20you%20again%20music%20video%20original" >See You Again <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>See You Again is still making leaps and bounds on the internet. As sung by Wiz Khalifa featuring Charlie Puth, See You Again was the primary song of Fast and Furious 7. The song was a tribute to Paul Walker, who died in a terrible car crash. Released in 2015, this <strong>Facebook music video</strong> sends the message of lifetime and friendship.</p><p>With the charged vocals of Charlie Puth and deep raps from Wiz Khalifa, the song took the third number on the graph sheet with 4.08 billion views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-facebook-music-videos-3.jpg"                      alt="see you again"                ></p><h3 id="Uptown-Funk"><a href="#Uptown-Funk" class="headerlink" title="Uptown Funk"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch?ref=search&v=220782386492496&external_log_id=95c5bda0-57d7-47f9-ba5e-01bd83cdb204&q=uptown%20funk%20bruno%20mars%20original" >Uptown Funk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Uptown Funk grew popular with its release in 2015 presented by Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars. The song made Ronson a star of Facebook when the <strong>Facebook song video</strong> reached 3.54 billion users. Two significant key elements made the song reach new levels.</p><p>The first one lacks a chorus and slower tempo that differentiated this from the crowd. The song gives old-school and nostalgic vibes to the audience. Resultantly, the track moved the music world and took it to a new era.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-facebook-music-videos-4.jpg"                      alt="uptown funk"                ></p><h3 id="Gangnam-Style"><a href="#Gangnam-Style" class="headerlink" title="Gangnam Style"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=452266614824106&external_log_id=4adf5454-510f-4579-a01f-aec31a147b06&q=gangnam%20style%20original" >Gangnam Style <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With more than 3.3 billion views and released to the world in 2012, it left a profound impression on Facebook users, most of whom were Korean. Being undeniably catchy and offering a quirkiness to the viewers, Gangnam Style refers to people living in Korea. They were trendy and had a class which the music video showed effortlessly.</p><p>Gangnam Style has silly dance moves that create an aura of excitement and help the audience forget their worries. The song came from Psy, who is enjoying international fame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-facebook-music-videos-5.jpg"                      alt="gangam style"                ></p><h3 id="Sorry"><a href="#Sorry" class="headerlink" title="Sorry"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=search&v=136149715168882&external_log_id=bd0d79ab-382c-4acf-b874-2f48fb6f10b0&q=sorry%20justin%20bieber%20original" >Sorry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The next appealing music video on Facebook that changed the narrative of vocalists worldwide is Sorry by Justin Bieber.

While designing your advertisements with the appropriate tools, you are required to have the potential and the knowledge to create the <strong>best animated Facebook ads.</strong> For this, there are several tips that can be realized and adopted by them which would help them <strong>create animated Facebook ads</strong> to perfection.</p><h3 id="Targeting-a-Specific-Audience"><a href="#Targeting-a-Specific-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Targeting a Specific Audience"></a>Targeting a Specific Audience</h3><p>While setting up an advertisement, it is very important to understand the audience that will be interacting with the advertisement. As Facebook can be effectively utilized for targeting a specific audience, thanks to its targeted ad campaigns, the design of the <strong>animated Facebook ads</strong> needs to be highly relevant to the audience that is to be subjectively discussed within it.</p><h3 id="Setting-Time-for-Running-Ads"><a href="#Setting-Time-for-Running-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Setting Time for Running Ads"></a>Setting Time for Running Ads</h3><p>Displaying ads at the perfect time gives you the best returns, all in all. Users need to look through their Facebook Analytics and come up with the best options of time scales that will be used for running ads across their accounts. With times having the highest traffic, brands can expect the highest returns across these time periods.</p><h3 id="Utilize-Facebook-Canvas-Ads"><a href="#Utilize-Facebook-Canvas-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Utilize Facebook Canvas Ads"></a>Utilize Facebook Canvas Ads</h3><p>The use of Facebook Canvas Ads is believed to be highly profitable in terms of the numbers associated with it. People have reportedly explained a considerable percentage of viewers to be looking into Canvas Ads for a greater time as compared to other advertisement styles. Although an advertisement contains the appropriate videos, photos, GIFs, and call-to-actions, defining the style and format of the advertisement holds similar importance.</p><h3 id="Using-Social-Proof"><a href="#Using-Social-Proof" class="headerlink" title="Using Social Proof"></a>Using Social Proof</h3><p>Animated ads are not generally focused on adding realistic frames and videos within them. However, adding social proof across your ads makes them more relevant and acknowledged by the consumer. People usually look for realistic proof before trusting a certain brand. Having such social proofs within your ads that would build up the trust of the consumer is promoted on all scales.</p><h3 id="Focusing-on-Retargeting-Campaigns"><a href="#Focusing-on-Retargeting-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Focusing on Retargeting Campaigns"></a>Focusing on Retargeting Campaigns</h3><p>Retargeting campaigns is not a common concept among most users. People usually work across their product and fail to gain the attention of their visitors. However, with the use of retargeting campaigns, people who are generally aware of the tool or product can be allured back into the system with ads that would be highly interactive. However, users need to make sure that the message within the ad is still relevant to their cause and target audience.</p><h3 id="Creating-Lookalikes-of-Your-Audience"><a href="#Creating-Lookalikes-of-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Creating Lookalikes of Your Audience"></a>Creating Lookalikes of Your Audience</h3><p>After setting up a proper target audience for your product or service, the user needs to proceed with setting up their lookalikes of the defined audience. Using such an approach is generally consistent and highly profitable, as this would help brands reach out to the problems of the audience and help them target the points that would effectively bring the attention of the viewer into the system.</p><h3 id="Do-a-Clear-Analysis-of-the-Competitors"><a href="#Do-a-Clear-Analysis-of-the-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Do a Clear Analysis of the Competitors"></a>Do a Clear Analysis of the Competitors</h3><p>It is quite important to be aware of what your competitors are up to.

Choosing the right one here can be tricky, but <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1438417719786914" >here’s a guide to help you out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some possible marketing objectives to choose from include:</p><ul><li>Brand Awareness</li><li>Reach</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Engagement</li><li>Lead Generation</li><li>Conversions</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-campaign-marketing-objective.jpg"                      alt="choosing Facebook campaign marketing objective "                ></p><p>Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective. Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing A Format"></a>2. Choosing A Format</h4><p>Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:</p><ul><li>Carousel</li><li>Single Image or Video</li><li>Collection group for Fullscreen Mobile Experience</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-ad-choose-format.jpg"                      alt="create Facebook ads - choose format "                ></p><p>Note: if you’ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, you’ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.</p><h4 id="3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements"><a href="#3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements"></a>3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements</h4><p>Go to the <strong>Media</strong> section and now you can upload up to 10 images or videos and Facebook Dynamic Creative will generate multiple combinations; or, you can create slideshow or use the Video Template to create a new video with the Video Creation Kit.</p><p><strong>Add images to media</strong></p><p>Once you’ve begun to create your vid, you’ll find a button under the <strong>Media</strong> tab. Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg"                      alt="add Facebook ads image assets "                ></p><p>When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!</p><h3 id="Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?"></a>Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?</h3><p>As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:</p><ul><li>Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%</li><li>Facebook video get, on average, over <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/" >8 billion daily views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer</li><li>Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate</li></ul><p>No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!</p><h3 id="What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For-3"><a href="#What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For-3" class="headerlink" title="What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?"></a>What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?</h3><p>Whatever the purpose of your video, you’ll find the Facebook Video Creation Kit to be quite useful for you.

Messenger allows the size of any media file, photo, or video not to exceed 25 MB. If the size exceeds the limit, Facebook Messenger will show an error.</p><h3 id="Reason-4-Session-Expired"><a href="#Reason-4-Session-Expired" class="headerlink" title="Reason 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Reason 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>Facebook Messenger has a certain time limit after which your login session expires.

Some fixes may be the same on both iPhone and Android, while others may vary depending upon your device’s operating system.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Network-Settings"><a href="#Fix-1-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Network Settings"></a><strong>Fix 1: Network Settings</strong></h3><p>Please check your Wi-Fi connection, restart your router, and reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. If you are using cellular data, the issue may be that the signals are weak, or your data plan may have expired. Check your data plan or contact your carrier.</p><p>In case of weaker signals, drop down your notification panel and set toggle on your Android or swipe down from the top to open the control center on your iPhone&#x2F;iOS device. Tap the airplane mode&#x2F;flight mode, denoted by a plane symbol. Please turn it on and wait for all connections to be shut off. Then tap it again, and all connections will be turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-1.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-2.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p>Doing this will connect your device to the nearest cell tower and improve signal quality, and your messages, videos, and photos will be sent on Facebook Messenger.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue"><a href="#Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>This is a relatively easy fix in devices using the Android operating system rather than devices with iOS. Go to settings, click on Apps, and scroll down to Messenger. By tapping on Messenger, it will open the App info menu of Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-3.png"                      alt="Click on Apps"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-4.png"                      alt="Click on Messenger App"                ></p><p>The menu will show you different options along with some stats as well. Tap on storage, and you will see the details of how Messenger is using the storage of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-5.png"                      alt="Click on storage"                ></p><p>At the bottom, you will see two main options, clear cache and clear data in this menu. At first, tap on clear cache, and it will clear all the temporary settings and extra data that you do not need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-6.png"                      alt="Clear Cache on Android"                ></p><p>This will hopefully solve the problem. If clearing cache does not help, tap on clear data. Clearing data will delete your account from the device, reset all permissions and settings.</p><p>You will need to sign in to Facebook Messenger again, but do not worry; it will not delete your pictures, videos, or personal data. Try to send any video or photo, and it will surely be effective, and your problem of Messenger not sending videos, photos or messages will be solved.</p><p>However, in iOS, you will have to restart your device by pressing and holding the power button until the power slider appears on the screen. Slide it to turn off your iOS device and wait for it to shut down completely. Power on the device again by pressing and holding the power button. This will clear some cache, but eventually, you might have to delete and reinstall Facebook Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-7.png"                      alt="Go to settings, click on General then click on iPhone storage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-8.png"                      alt="Select the app and Clear cache"                ></p><p>Head down to the settings, General, iPhone storage, and scroll down to Facebook Messenger. After tapping on Messenger, you will see an option to delete the app. Delete it and then open the App Store, from where you can easily reinstall Facebook messenger, and you will be good to go after logging in!</p><h3 id="Fix-3-File-Size-Issue"><a href="#Fix-3-File-Size-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: File Size Issue"></a><strong>Fix 3: File Size Issue</strong></h3><p>Facebook itself allows the uploading of files up to 4 GB. Still, Facebook Messenger is limited to 25 MB, and the reason your videos or photos might not be getting through is that your file size is exceeding Facebook Messenger’s file size limit.</p><p>One fix is that you can send the video or photo by directly sharing it from your file manager or gallery rather than choosing the file from messenger’s inbuilt option. That might not always work.</p><p>An easy solution is that you use any video editing software such as WonderShare Filmora for this job. WonderShare Filmora is a very powerful software with many features that you can use to edit your videos.</p><p>The size issue can be solved by either cropping the video a little bit or simply exporting the video using WonderShare Filmora in a lower quality setting, e.g., If the video is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, you can export it in 1280 x 720 resolution. This will only affect the quality a little bit but will significantly reduce the size of your video, and it will easily get through Facebook Messenger’s size limit.</p><p>Another unpopular and unconventional fix to this issue is that you can compress the video into a zip file and then send it as a document to the other person or you can also upload it onto Google Drive or any online storage drive and share the link on Facebook Messenger so the other person can easily access the full-sized file in its original quality.</p><h3 id="Fix-4-Session-Expired"><a href="#Fix-4-Session-Expired" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Fix 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>This is a very simple issue with an even simpler fix. If your session has expired, it means that you have been logged in for too long and your hosting servers have timed out. Facebook Messenger will show either ‘Session Expired’ or ‘Session Timed Out’ depending on your software version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-9.png"                      alt="Session Expired Facebook Messenger"                ></p><p>All you have to do is press ‘OK,’ and it will take you to the login screen where you can put in your credentials, and you will be logged in to Facebook Messenger again, and then you can easily send messages, videos, and photos.</p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked"><a href="#Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked"></a><strong>Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, there is currently no fix to this issue. If someone has restricted you or blocked you on Facebook or Messenger, you cannot contact them or send them messages. You have to contact them through some other medium or application.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips"><a href="#Bonus-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips"></a>Bonus Tips</h2><h3 id="Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android"></a><strong>Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android</strong></h3><p>If your text messages are not sent, the most common issue can be a network problem. Either your signals are weak, or if you are using iMessage on iOS or its mirror service on Androids that uses Google Duo, it means that your internet or mobile data is not working.</p><p>To fix the cellular signal issue, you have to toggle on Flight mode until it cuts off all connections and then toggles it off again to regain connectivity. Doing this will connect you to the nearest cellphone tower, and you will get the best possible network coverage. This will also help in providing better cellular data coverage as well.</p><p>For Wi-Fi, either reconnect your phone to a different Wi-Fi network or manually restart your router, and that will hopefully solve the internet issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know all the finicky tips and trips on fixing Facebook Messenger, not sending videos, photos, or messages, nothing can stop you from having a smooth and fun experience. You can now follow these easy fixes and seamlessly share memories with your friends, family, and loved ones in the form of videos, photos, and text messages.</p><p>Now there is no need to worry regardless of what device you have or what operating system it has, iOS or Android; these fixes have got you covered!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In this era of the internet and social media, people’s connections and interactions have also changed.

Most people have shifted from the traditional cellular SMS and MMS to online platforms that back up all your chats and make them accessible from multiple devices.</p><p>Facebook is one of the most popular social media websites&#x2F;applications, and now its Facebook Messenger is one of the top messaging apps in the entire world. You can easily send text messages, photos, videos, and voice notes.</p><p>Sometimes due to an issue, Facebook Messenger cannot send videos or photos; that is what you will learn in this article and how to fix those issues.</p><h2 id="Why-Can-Facebook-Messenger-Not-Send-Videos-and-Photos-3"><a href="#Why-Can-Facebook-Messenger-Not-Send-Videos-and-Photos-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Can Facebook Messenger Not Send Videos and Photos"></a>Why Can Facebook Messenger Not Send Videos and Photos</h2><h3 id="Reason-1-Network-Problem-3"><a href="#Reason-1-Network-Problem-3" class="headerlink" title="Reason 1: Network Problem"></a><strong>Reason 1: Network Problem</strong></h3><p>One of the most common problems is when your messages, photos, or videos are not sent on Facebook Messenger is a network issue. Either your Wi-Fi is not working properly, or there is an issue with your cell carrier. You may have run out of data allowance, or the signals might not be strong enough to upload your videos or photos.</p><h3 id="Reason-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3"><a href="#Reason-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Reason 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Reason 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>Another reason why Facebook messenger is not sending messages could be that your device’s storage is full or its cache memory has reached its maximum and is not registering anything new that is being fed into the application.</p><h3 id="Reason-3-File-Size-Exceeding-Limit-3"><a href="#Reason-3-File-Size-Exceeding-Limit-3" class="headerlink" title="Reason 3: File Size Exceeding Limit"></a><strong>Reason 3: File Size Exceeding Limit</strong></h3><p>One of the reasons that may be the cause of the failed photo or video upload can be that the file you are trying to upload exceeds the limits set by Facebook messenger. Messenger allows the size of any media file, photo, or video not to exceed 25 MB. If the size exceeds the limit, Facebook Messenger will show an error.</p><h3 id="Reason-4-Session-Expired-3"><a href="#Reason-4-Session-Expired-3" class="headerlink" title="Reason 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Reason 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>Facebook Messenger has a certain time limit after which your login session expires. It will give you a prompt saying the login session has expired. That can also be a reason why Messenger is not sending videos and photos.</p><h3 id="Reason-5-Restricted-Blocked-3"><a href="#Reason-5-Restricted-Blocked-3" class="headerlink" title="Reason 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked"></a><strong>Reason 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked</strong></h3><p>Suppose your messages have not been delivered, and you see a hollow circle beside your text message or video&#x2F;photo. In that case, there is an unfortunate chance that you may have been restricted or blocked by the recipient while you were sending your message.</p><p>Another chance is that the recipient may have deactivated their account right after you pressed sent, and that is why Messenger may not have delivered your message, photo, or video.</p><h2 id="How-to-Fix-Messenger-on-iPhone-and-Android-3"><a href="#How-to-Fix-Messenger-on-iPhone-and-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Fix Messenger on iPhone and Android"></a>How to Fix Messenger on iPhone and Android</h2><p>Here are the fixes to the issues mentioned above. Some fixes may be the same on both iPhone and Android, while others may vary depending upon your device’s operating system.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Network-Settings-3"><a href="#Fix-1-Network-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Network Settings"></a><strong>Fix 1: Network Settings</strong></h3><p>Please check your Wi-Fi connection, restart your router, and reconnect to your Wi-Fi network. If you are using cellular data, the issue may be that the signals are weak, or your data plan may have expired. Check your data plan or contact your carrier.</p><p>In case of weaker signals, drop down your notification panel and set toggle on your Android or swipe down from the top to open the control center on your iPhone&#x2F;iOS device. Tap the airplane mode&#x2F;flight mode, denoted by a plane symbol. Please turn it on and wait for all connections to be shut off. Then tap it again, and all connections will be turned on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-1.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-2.png"                      alt="Click on Aeroplane icon"                ></p><p>Doing this will connect your device to the nearest cell tower and improve signal quality, and your messages, videos, and photos will be sent on Facebook Messenger.</p><h3 id="Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3"><a href="#Fix-2-Phone-Storage-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue"></a><strong>Fix 2: Phone Storage Issue</strong></h3><p>This is a relatively easy fix in devices using the Android operating system rather than devices with iOS. Go to settings, click on Apps, and scroll down to Messenger. By tapping on Messenger, it will open the App info menu of Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-3.png"                      alt="Click on Apps"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-4.png"                      alt="Click on Messenger App"                ></p><p>The menu will show you different options along with some stats as well. Tap on storage, and you will see the details of how Messenger is using the storage of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-5.png"                      alt="Click on storage"                ></p><p>At the bottom, you will see two main options, clear cache and clear data in this menu. At first, tap on clear cache, and it will clear all the temporary settings and extra data that you do not need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-6.png"                      alt="Clear Cache on Android"                ></p><p>This will hopefully solve the problem. If clearing cache does not help, tap on clear data. Clearing data will delete your account from the device, reset all permissions and settings.</p><p>You will need to sign in to Facebook Messenger again, but do not worry; it will not delete your pictures, videos, or personal data. Try to send any video or photo, and it will surely be effective, and your problem of Messenger not sending videos, photos or messages will be solved.</p><p>However, in iOS, you will have to restart your device by pressing and holding the power button until the power slider appears on the screen. Slide it to turn off your iOS device and wait for it to shut down completely. Power on the device again by pressing and holding the power button. This will clear some cache, but eventually, you might have to delete and reinstall Facebook Messenger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-7.png"                      alt="Go to settings, click on General then click on iPhone storage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-8.png"                      alt="Select the app and Clear cache"                ></p><p>Head down to the settings, General, iPhone storage, and scroll down to Facebook Messenger. After tapping on Messenger, you will see an option to delete the app. Delete it and then open the App Store, from where you can easily reinstall Facebook messenger, and you will be good to go after logging in!</p><h3 id="Fix-3-File-Size-Issue-3"><a href="#Fix-3-File-Size-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: File Size Issue"></a><strong>Fix 3: File Size Issue</strong></h3><p>Facebook itself allows the uploading of files up to 4 GB. Still, Facebook Messenger is limited to 25 MB, and the reason your videos or photos might not be getting through is that your file size is exceeding Facebook Messenger’s file size limit.</p><p>One fix is that you can send the video or photo by directly sharing it from your file manager or gallery rather than choosing the file from messenger’s inbuilt option. That might not always work.</p><p>An easy solution is that you use any video editing software such as WonderShare Filmora for this job. WonderShare Filmora is a very powerful software with many features that you can use to edit your videos.</p><p>The size issue can be solved by either cropping the video a little bit or simply exporting the video using WonderShare Filmora in a lower quality setting, e.g., If the video is in 1920 x 1080 resolution, you can export it in 1280 x 720 resolution. This will only affect the quality a little bit but will significantly reduce the size of your video, and it will easily get through Facebook Messenger’s size limit.</p><p>Another unpopular and unconventional fix to this issue is that you can compress the video into a zip file and then send it as a document to the other person or you can also upload it onto Google Drive or any online storage drive and share the link on Facebook Messenger so the other person can easily access the full-sized file in its original quality.</p><h3 id="Fix-4-Session-Expired-3"><a href="#Fix-4-Session-Expired-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4: Session Expired"></a><strong>Fix 4: Session Expired</strong></h3><p>This is a very simple issue with an even simpler fix. If your session has expired, it means that you have been logged in for too long and your hosting servers have timed out. Facebook Messenger will show either ‘Session Expired’ or ‘Session Timed Out’ depending on your software version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-messenger-not-sending-videos-9.png"                      alt="Session Expired Facebook Messenger"                ></p><p>All you have to do is press ‘OK,’ and it will take you to the login screen where you can put in your credentials, and you will be logged in to Facebook Messenger again, and then you can easily send messages, videos, and photos.</p><h3 id="Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked-3"><a href="#Fix-5-Restricted-Blocked-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked"></a><strong>Fix 5: Restricted&#x2F;Blocked</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, there is currently no fix to this issue. If someone has restricted you or blocked you on Facebook or Messenger, you cannot contact them or send them messages. You have to contact them through some other medium or application.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips"></a>Bonus Tips</h2><h3 id="Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android-3"><a href="#Messages-Not-Sending-on-iPhone-and-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android"></a><strong>Messages Not Sending on iPhone and Android</strong></h3><p>If your text messages are not sent, the most common issue can be a network problem. Either your signals are weak, or if you are using iMessage on iOS or its mirror service on Androids that uses Google Duo, it means that your internet or mobile data is not working.</p><p>To fix the cellular signal issue, you have to toggle on Flight mode until it cuts off all connections and then toggles it off again to regain connectivity. Doing this will connect you to the nearest cellphone tower, and you will get the best possible network coverage. This will also help in providing better cellular data coverage as well.</p><p>For Wi-Fi, either reconnect your phone to a different Wi-Fi network or manually restart your router, and that will hopefully solve the internet issue.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know all the finicky tips and trips on fixing Facebook Messenger, not sending videos, photos, or messages, nothing can stop you from having a smooth and fun experience.
