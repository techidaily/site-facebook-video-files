This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ Alternatively, you can also choose to ‘Create live video events.’ Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-10.png"                      alt="choose to go live or schedule an event"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can choose to ‘Go Live.’ This means you can simply go live for a casual update.

This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for ‘Start Screen Share.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-12.png"                      alt="share screen on facebook live"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you click on ‘Start Screen Share,’ a new dialog box pops open. It gives you the option of sharing’ Entire Screen.’, ‘Window,’ or ‘Chrome Tabs.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Under the ‘Entire Screen’ option, you can share the current window open as ‘Screen 1’. You can also share your desktop background if you choose. This shows up as ‘Screen 2’. Once you’ve made your choice, tap on the ‘Share’ button. This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel. Fill out details like the live stream title in the ‘Title Required’ box. You can add additional descriptions in the prompt box beneath the title box. Click on ‘Next’ when you’re done filling in the details.</p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You’ll now see the Dashboard. Beneath the Dashboard, you can spot the ‘Go Live’ button. Once you’re happy with the live video setup, you can click on the ‘Go Live’ button. The live video is set up with a countdown from three to one. Your video then goes live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-14.png"                      alt="go live using screen share on facebook"                ></p><p>One drawback to the Facebook live screen share function is that you can’t show your face. It cannot support screen sharing and a window with webcam settings simultaneously. You can get around this function by using a video editor like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It is a feature-rich video editor.

Here’s how you can do it.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign Into Facebook On Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>You can watch any Facebook live video on your PC or MacBook. First, you need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/" >www.facebook.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log in. After entering your credentials, you can set about finding a way to watch live streams.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-1.png"                      alt="login to facebook"                ></p><p>You can also watch live streams on your web browser without logging in. For this, you will need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/live" >www.facebook.com/watch/live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&#x2F;. This will let you search for the particular live stream you’re looking for. Please note that you can watch the video to your heart’s content. You will not interact with the video through emoji reactions or comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-2.png"                      alt="access facebook live with video url"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select The Watch (TV) Icon</strong></p><p>You’ll notice a row of icons at the top of the Facebook page. From those icons, select an icon that looks like a small tv. This icon will take you to the section with live streams and edited videos for upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-3.png"                      alt="use watch to catch facebook live streams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on the Live tab.</strong></p><p>An alternative to that step is to click on the Live tab. You can find the live tab on the left-hand side panel. This opens a new page where you can watch live videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-4.png"                      alt="click on the live tab on facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Look for the Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-5.png"                      alt="use menu to watch facebook live"                ></p><p>You can also tap on the ‘Menu,’ indicated by nine dots. This will open a drop-down menu where you can scroll down. Select ‘watch’ to take you to the live stream page you want to see.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png"                      alt="use menu to look for live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams</strong></p><p>Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red ‘Live’ tab on the top left corner.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Communicate on Chat</strong></p><p>You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions.

You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method"><a href="#First-Method" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu.

You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method-3"><a href="#First-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method-3"><a href="#Second-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes.

Come on!</p><h2 id="Get-Started-with-Filmora"><a href="#Get-Started-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with Filmora"></a>Get Started with Filmora</h2><p>A square video in a <strong>1:1 aspect ratio</strong> is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch"></a>Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch</h2><p>This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:</p><ul><li>1. Open Filmora, start the project at <strong>1:1</strong> square or Instagram mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="start-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2. Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>Import Media</strong> and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920*1080 at 16:9)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg"                      alt="import-sample-video"                ></p><ul><li>3. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="automatic-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>4. Add a subtitle under <strong>Titles</strong> tab to the letterbox at the top and bottom and custom the texts you want.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-letterbox-title.jpg"                      alt="add-letterbox-title"                ></p><p>And you can also go to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and add some creative elements such as emoji to the letterbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-elements.jpg"                      alt="add-emoji-elements"                ></p><ul><li>5. Export the square video to local computer in mp4 or other supported formats</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-export-panel"                ></p><ul><li>6. Upload the exported square video to Facebook, and show how it looks like on Facebook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-on-facebook.jpg"                      alt="post-on-facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes"><a href="#Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes"></a>Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes</h2><p>This method is suitable for the source videos in a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 1080*1080). Let us see the steps below:</p><ul><li>1. Start the project at 1:1 square or Instagram mode, and import your source video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-square-video.jpg"                      alt="import-square-video"                ></p><ul><li>2. Then drag and drop your source video to the timeline. No black bars will appear automatically like in Method 1</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="no-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>3. To create a letterbox, choose the option <strong>Titles</strong>. Now you will be shown a variety of subtitles and credit styles</li><li>4. Select <strong>Subtitles</strong>, then add a subtitle style that has a black background to your video, such as Subtitle 1,2,3, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-doll-subtitle.jpg"                      alt="add-doll-subtitle"                ></p><ul><li>5. You will see that the subtitle appears on the video in real time. Here you can adjust the width and height of the subtitle. Make it so that that black bar covers the lower end of the video completely and delete the text</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="custom-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>6. Drag and drop the subtitle again from the Titles-Subtitles option. This time for the top section of the video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-subtitle-again.jpg"                      alt="add-subtitle-again"                ></p><ul><li>7. You can input your own texts in the box or delete the text as you want, and you will be left with a video that has black bars on the top and bottom</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-both-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="get-both-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>8. Export the video to your computer or phone in mp4, then upload it to Facebook, and finally, you will see the magic!</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-my-video.jpg"                      alt="post-my-video"                ></p><h2 id="To-Sum-up"><a href="#To-Sum-up" class="headerlink" title="To Sum up"></a>To Sum up</h2><p>Adding a letterbox, then designing your own texts, elements and filters will bring great creativity to your video on Facebook.

An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pic-compare.jpg"                      alt="pic-compare"                ></p><p>Want to have a try? Come on!</p><h2 id="Get-Started-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Get-Started-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Get Started with Filmora"></a>Get Started with Filmora</h2><p>A square video in a <strong>1:1 aspect ratio</strong> is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch-3"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-Letterbox-by-Project-Ratio-Mismatch-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch"></a>Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch</h2><p>This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:</p><ul><li>1. Open Filmora, start the project at <strong>1:1</strong> square or Instagram mode</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg"                      alt="start-filmora9"                ></p><ul><li>2. Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>Import Media</strong> and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920*1080 at 16:9)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg"                      alt="import-sample-video"                ></p><ul><li>3. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/automatic-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="automatic-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>4. Add a subtitle under <strong>Titles</strong> tab to the letterbox at the top and bottom and custom the texts you want.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-letterbox-title.jpg"                      alt="add-letterbox-title"                ></p><p>And you can also go to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and add some creative elements such as emoji to the letterbox.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-elements.jpg"                      alt="add-emoji-elements"                ></p><ul><li>5. Export the square video to local computer in mp4 or other supported formats</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"                      alt="filmora9-export-panel"                ></p><ul><li>6. Upload the exported square video to Facebook, and show how it looks like on Facebook.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/post-on-facebook.jpg"                      alt="post-on-facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes-3"><a href="#Method-2-Create-a-Letterbox-by-Adding-Text-Shapes-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes"></a>Method 2: Create a Letterbox by Adding Text Shapes</h2><p>This method is suitable for the source videos in a 1:1 ratio (e.g. 1080*1080). Let us see the steps below:</p><ul><li>1. Start the project at 1:1 square or Instagram mode, and import your source video</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-square-video.jpg"                      alt="import-square-video"                ></p><ul><li>2. Then drag and drop your source video to the timeline. No black bars will appear automatically like in Method 1</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/no-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="no-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>3. To create a letterbox, choose the option <strong>Titles</strong>. Now you will be shown a variety of subtitles and credit styles</li><li>4. Select <strong>Subtitles</strong>, then add a subtitle style that has a black background to your video, such as Subtitle 1,2,3, etc.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-doll-subtitle.jpg"                      alt="add-doll-subtitle"                ></p><ul><li>5. You will see that the subtitle appears on the video in real time. Here you can adjust the width and height of the subtitle. Make it so that that black bar covers the lower end of the video completely and delete the text</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-letterbox.jpg"                      alt="custom-letterbox"                ></p><ul><li>6.

To answer this question, it is better to go through a few situations that would explain how a user can assess their content to have copyright. Considering you appear in a video or photo, it necessarily does not provide you the copyrights over it.</p><p>On the other hand, anything that you or a client has potentially created provides you with certain copyrights over it.

What Are My Options?"></a>Part 2: I Posted a Video on Facebook, Which was Removed Immediately! What Are My Options?</h2><p>Are you confused with the question of “<strong>Facebook removed my video due to copyright</strong>?” Videos removed immediately after being posted across Facebook usually contain someone else’s copyrighted content. This may occur across the video, audio, or content that has been utilized across the post. However, it is important to look into the reasons and the options that a user may have after removing their video from the platform.</p><p>An email and a notification over copyright infringement will be sent to the perpetrator, which includes some confirmations over the point of posting the content. Facebook tries to come up with a middle-way solution for its users, providing them effective results over the issues such as the copyright action. If you are still confident in posting the content, Facebook requires some confirmation or other possibilities to help you publish the content.</p><p>On the other hand, if it seems impossible to get to a solution over the ownership rights of the content, users are advised to connect with the owner to resolve the issue directly. Since the notification mentions the content owner who filed for copyright actions, you can easily get in touch with the person to resolve the issue. You can also consider appealing the removal of your content for gaining appropriate reasons over its removal.</p><p>The information that is received by the user containing the details of the applicant filing for copyright action is provided as follows:</p><ul><li>Report number and owner’s name.</li><li>Email address of the reporting party.</li><li>Details of the report and instructions to be followed, if any.</li><li>Guide to submit an appeal</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-Over-Repeating-Infringement"><a href="#What-Happens-Over-Repeating-Infringement" class="headerlink" title="What Happens Over Repeating Infringement"></a>What Happens Over Repeating Infringement</h3><p>Facebook has a no-tolerance policy for users who repeatedly breach the copyright of other users’ content. Under such circumstances, the platform considers disabling the account or the page is run, if any. While abiding by the rules, Facebook either restricts your posting across the platform or completely disables the account, mostly based on the extent of the infringement.</p><h3 id="How-Does-a-Copyright-Report-Proceed"><a href="#How-Does-a-Copyright-Report-Proceed" class="headerlink" title="How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?"></a>How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?</h3><p>This information is useful for users who report <strong>Facebook video copyright</strong> breaches of their content over someone’s post. Facebook receives the email and provides you with the particular number that would act as the identification of the ‘ticket’ created. Once done, Facebook looks into the issue and notifies the person that has breached the copyrights.</p><p>However, under some circumstances, Facebook demands some questions for the person submitting the report, intending to know more about the case if not clarified. Once clear, clear action is taken by the authorities, with proper notifications sent to the user explaining the updates of the report.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Make-Sure-that-Posted-Content-Does-Not-Violate-Copyright-Law"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Make-Sure-that-Posted-Content-Does-Not-Violate-Copyright-Law" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips to Make Sure that Posted Content Does Not Violate Copyright Law"></a>Part 3: Tips to Make Sure that Posted Content Does Not Violate Copyright Law</h2><p>This part provides users with some tips to prevent them from facing copyright infringement allegations. While being across Facebook, users need to follow a set of tips that would explain how to protect themselves from violating copyright law. There are a few things that a user needs to prevent using across their posts. While focusing on these points, users would be more in control of their content.</p><ul><li>Refrain from using bought or downloaded content from websites, such as iTunes.</li><li>Content that has been recorded across personal recording devices.</li><li>Try to give credit to the owner of the content.</li><li>Add a disclaimer that would clear the intention of using copyright content or infringing it.</li><li>Do not intend to profit from the content.</li><li>Try to add original content in major proportion across your content.</li><li>Do not think that the posted content is of fair use.</li></ul><p>While covering these points mentioned above, you should also be vocal in getting permission to use the work of another owner across your design. With an idea over these points, you are quite sure how and what to post across Facebook. While covering all the points discussed above, it can avoid copyright infringement across the content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The copyright claim is an important part of the content made across the ambits of originality.

On the other hand, Trademarks are more directed to prevent harm and confusion among customers.</p><p>Trademarks are usually consulted over identifying a company that prevents other users from copying their logos and names to confuse the customers. This type is directed towards offering consumers protection over duplication.</p><h2 id="Part-2-I-Posted-a-Video-on-Facebook-Which-was-Removed-Immediately-What-Are-My-Options-3"><a href="#Part-2-I-Posted-a-Video-on-Facebook-Which-was-Removed-Immediately-What-Are-My-Options-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: I Posted a Video on Facebook, Which was Removed Immediately! What Are My Options?"></a>Part 2: I Posted a Video on Facebook, Which was Removed Immediately! What Are My Options?</h2><p>Are you confused with the question of “<strong>Facebook removed my video due to copyright</strong>?” Videos removed immediately after being posted across Facebook usually contain someone else’s copyrighted content. This may occur across the video, audio, or content that has been utilized across the post. However, it is important to look into the reasons and the options that a user may have after removing their video from the platform.</p><p>An email and a notification over copyright infringement will be sent to the perpetrator, which includes some confirmations over the point of posting the content. Facebook tries to come up with a middle-way solution for its users, providing them effective results over the issues such as the copyright action. If you are still confident in posting the content, Facebook requires some confirmation or other possibilities to help you publish the content.</p><p>On the other hand, if it seems impossible to get to a solution over the ownership rights of the content, users are advised to connect with the owner to resolve the issue directly. Since the notification mentions the content owner who filed for copyright actions, you can easily get in touch with the person to resolve the issue. You can also consider appealing the removal of your content for gaining appropriate reasons over its removal.</p><p>The information that is received by the user containing the details of the applicant filing for copyright action is provided as follows:</p><ul><li>Report number and owner’s name.</li><li>Email address of the reporting party.</li><li>Details of the report and instructions to be followed, if any.</li><li>Guide to submit an appeal</li></ul><h3 id="What-Happens-Over-Repeating-Infringement-3"><a href="#What-Happens-Over-Repeating-Infringement-3" class="headerlink" title="What Happens Over Repeating Infringement"></a>What Happens Over Repeating Infringement</h3><p>Facebook has a no-tolerance policy for users who repeatedly breach the copyright of other users’ content. Under such circumstances, the platform considers disabling the account or the page is run, if any. While abiding by the rules, Facebook either restricts your posting across the platform or completely disables the account, mostly based on the extent of the infringement.</p><h3 id="How-Does-a-Copyright-Report-Proceed-3"><a href="#How-Does-a-Copyright-Report-Proceed-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?"></a>How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?</h3><p>This information is useful for users who report <strong>Facebook video copyright</strong> breaches of their content over someone’s post. Facebook receives the email and provides you with the particular number that would act as the identification of the ‘ticket’ created. Once done, Facebook looks into the issue and notifies the person that has breached the copyrights.</p><p>However, under some circumstances, Facebook demands some questions for the person submitting the report, intending to know more about the case if not clarified. Once clear, clear action is taken by the authorities, with proper notifications sent to the user explaining the updates of the report.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Make-Sure-that-Posted-Content-Does-Not-Violate-Copyright-Law-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Make-Sure-that-Posted-Content-Does-Not-Violate-Copyright-Law-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips to Make Sure that Posted Content Does Not Violate Copyright Law"></a>Part 3: Tips to Make Sure that Posted Content Does Not Violate Copyright Law</h2><p>This part provides users with some tips to prevent them from facing copyright infringement allegations. While being across Facebook, users need to follow a set of tips that would explain how to protect themselves from violating copyright law. There are a few things that a user needs to prevent using across their posts. While focusing on these points, users would be more in control of their content.</p><ul><li>Refrain from using bought or downloaded content from websites, such as iTunes.</li><li>Content that has been recorded across personal recording devices.</li><li>Try to give credit to the owner of the content.</li><li>Add a disclaimer that would clear the intention of using copyright content or infringing it.</li><li>Do not intend to profit from the content.</li><li>Try to add original content in major proportion across your content.</li><li>Do not think that the posted content is of fair use.</li></ul><p>While covering these points mentioned above, you should also be vocal in getting permission to use the work of another owner across your design. With an idea over these points, you are quite sure how and what to post across Facebook. While covering all the points discussed above, it can avoid copyright infringement across the content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The copyright claim is an important part of the content made across the ambits of originality. Users work across their designs, documents, or models, which requires particular protection. While surviving across platforms such as Facebook, the tool ensures that the content posted across the platform is out of the boundaries of <strong>Facebook video copyright</strong> infringement. Facebook has kept a no-tolerance policy for such cases and advises users to follow a set of options that would help them prevent such problems in the future.</p><p><a class="link"

Once you’re done, click the green “Share Your Movie” button at the top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/edit-look-back-video.png"                      alt="edit look back video" title="edit look back video"                ></p><p> Now you’ve selected the image you like.

If you visit that page, Facebook’s algorithm will auto-generate a video of your profile history. It will show the year you joined Facebook, your most-liked photos, statuses with the most engagement, accompanied with a standard piece of music.</p><p> It’s pretty cool. But unfortunately, Facebook’s choice of pictures isn’t. You may have to see some embarrassing old photos, or status updates that were funny at the time. In that case, you need to select the pictures of your choice, right?</p><p> The good new is that, Facebook has introduced a new editor now, which lets you choose your favorite images for the video. To edit the Look Back video, simply hit the “Edit” button on the top right corner of the Look Back page. Then un-check the photos and updates you don’t want in your video, and check the ones that you want include. Once you’re done, click the green “Share Your Movie” button at the top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/edit-look-back-video.png"                      alt="edit look back video" title="edit look back video"                ></p><p> Now you’ve selected the image you like.

Most people near us are influencers or content creators who create interesting short videos to entertain people all around the globe.</p><p>With an interface similar to Snapchat, TikTok allows you to add filters, sounds, and effects to your 15-second TikTok videos. Even if you don’t hold an account, you can watch thousands of videos on Tik Tok.</p><p>But most importantly, as a content creator, you can also share those videos with people on your other social media platforms, such as Facebook. In this article, we will show you how you can share a TikTok video on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Social Media Integration</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Social-Media-Integration"><a href="#Part-1-Social-Media-Integration" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Social Media Integration"></a>Part 1: Social Media Integration</h2><p>The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.</p><p>What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.</p><p>An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren’t on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.</p><p>If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Can-You-Share-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-on-iPhone-or-iPad"><a href="#Part-2-How-Can-You-Share-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-on-iPhone-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?"></a>Part 2: How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?</h2><p>If you are an Apple user, you will most likely have a very different method to share your TikTok videos than Android users. To ensure that you can share your videos seamlessly and quickly, we have listed all the steps below. So, Let’s begin:</p><p><strong>1. Open TikTok:</strong></p><p>Tap on the TikTok app on your iPhone or iPad to open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Open TikTok"                ></p><p><strong>2. Select the Video:</strong></p><p>Now, in the next step, you need to select the video you want to share. You can share any video from the discover page, newsfeed, and a user’s profile.</p><p><strong>3. Share The Video:</strong></p><p>Click on the video to start playing it. Once the video is playing, you will spot a small white arrow on the right side. Click on the arrow to share the TikTok video to Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share The Video"                ></p><p><strong>4. Select Facebook from the share options:</strong></p><p>Now, the iPhone will give you options for the apps you want to share the video with. Tap on Facebook to share the video to Facebook.</p><p>Once you tap on the Facebook icon, you will be prompted to open Facebook if you are sharing from TikTok to Facebook for the first time. Click on Open to continue.</p><p>The Facebook App will now open, and your selected TikTok video will be shown on the new post screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="Select Facebook from the share options"                ></p><p><strong>5. Select where you want to post:</strong></p><p>At the top of the screen, you will see the words “Your Timeline”. Tap on it to change where you want to post the video. You can choose to post it in a group, a friend’s timeline, or Facebook newsfeed.</p><p>In case you are also managing a page, you can also post the video there by selecting your page. This will post the video on the page’s timeline.</p><p><strong>6. Add a caption for your video:</strong></p><p>To add a caption to your post, tap on the “Say something about this” box and write whatever you like. You can also add your location, add emojis or customize your post before posting.</p><p><strong>7. Tap the Share :</strong></p><p>Now tap on the Share button on the top right corner to share the video with your friends.</p><p>An important point to note here is that if you have chosen the destination as your timeline, you will be prompted to select if you want to post the TikTok to your Facebook story or Facebook Newsfeed. Select the option you want and then click on Share Now.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-YouShare-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-without-Watermark"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-YouShare-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-without-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark"></a>Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark</h2><p>While sometimes you might share videos from TikTok to Facebook, other times you might want to post the same video on Facebook without linking it back to your TikTok account. This is especially useful if you are going to post the same video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts.</p><p>However, this can be a bit tricky with the TikTok watermark over the video. But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account. Let’s dive right in:</p><h3 id="To-Remove-Watermark-from-Tiktok-Videos-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#To-Remove-Watermark-from-Tiktok-Videos-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android"></a>To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android</h3><p>Most software these days only allow you to remove watermarks in their premium versions, where you might have to pay some extra bucks to avail that feature. But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.</p><p>The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.</p><p>1. Download the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apowersoft.com/record-all-screen" >ApowerREC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your phone and launch it.</p><p>2. Tap on the settings icon in the button on the right corner of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Tap on the settings icon"                ></p><p>3. Make sure you have turned on the Recording Overlay and Screenshot overlay. This will help you to record and take a screenshot of the video simultaneously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Turned on the Recording Overlay"                ></p><p>4. By default, TikTok videos are in a vertical format, so you would need to set the recording in the portrait style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-6.jpg"                      alt="Set the recording in the portrait style"                ></p><p>5. Start the recording now to record the video. If you want to take screenshots of the video, click on the camera icon towards the left edge of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-7.jpg"                      alt="Click on the camera icon"                ></p><p>6. To discover other options while you record the video, you can tap on the overlay button. This will give you the option to pause, stop or hide the menu. You can even add an image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Tap on the overlay button"                ></p><p>7. Stop the Recording when you are finished. You will then find the recorded video in the ApowerRec app, and now you can preview it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-9.jpg"                      alt="Stop the Recording"                ></p><p>8. Once you have recorded the video without a watermark, the next step is to share it on your social media. ApowerREC allows you to share those recordings directly to Facebook from the app.</p><p>And voila! You have done it. You have shared a TikTok video to Facebook without the hassle of a watermark.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-Watermark-from-Videos-on-PC"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Watermark-from-Videos-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Watermark from Videos on PC"></a>How to Remove Watermark from Videos on PC</h3><p>If you want to record and edit videos on your PC, then we recommend that you use Wondershare Democreator.

Open Wondershare Democreator on your Desktop and start a new recording by clicking on New Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-10.jpg"                      alt="Open Wondershare Democreator"                ></p><p>4. Check the settings before starting the recording. Make sure you disable the camera and the microphone, so the recorder only records the system sound.

As soon as this cursor appears, drag your image up to duration of your background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-facebook-watermark.jpg"                      alt="preview facebook watermark"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Now adjust the position and other details of your watermark image:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transform-options.jpg"                      alt="adjust watermark"                ></p><p>Wondershare Filmora allows easy customization of watermark while allowing users to edit its motion, size and position etc. Here are few details about basic settings:</p><p><strong>Motion:</strong> It will offer you 30 unique motion effect selection options that can help to animate your watermark. Whenever you select any motion to your watermark then software will indicate its effect on screen.</p><p><strong>Position:</strong> Users can easily drag their watermark on any portion of video using mouse and place it at any desired location.</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Simply drag handles of your watermark image and then resize your watermark as per need of your project. Go to advanced tab if you want to edit effects and mask of your PIP window.</p><p><strong>Mask:</strong> Check all available shapes for your watermark appearance and then double clip on desired shape. Users can also make adjustments for width and height of watermark.</p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> Using this tab, you can add various effects on your watermark like alpha changes, flip, rotate, transparency, blur, shadow and border etc.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: It is time to prepare uploading your edited watermarked videos on Facebook. To do this, simply hit the Export button available on your timeline. It will take you to the output window where you can export video to MP4 format, and then hit the Export button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video-9.jpg"                      alt="export facebook watermark video"                ></p><p>As soon as your export process is over then you can click over the link or use Find Target button on screen and it will immediately lead you to your recently updated watermarked video. It is also possible to save watermarked videos in any desired format on PC itself or users can also transfer them to external storage device like DVD.</p><p><a
