Of course, you don’t want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.</p><p>With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Billions of users log into the site each day to check on friends, post status updates and read the latest news. And brands hope to use Facebook by working with influencers to reach their target audience.</p><p> We will help you learn how to increase followers on Facebook, which will allow your brand to take advantage of the power of social media marketing.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-on-How-to-Increase-Followers-on-Facebook"><a href="#10-Tips-on-How-to-Increase-Followers-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips on How to Increase Followers on Facebook"></a>10 Tips on How to Increase Followers on Facebook</h2><h3 id="1-Create-Trendy-Content"><a href="#1-Create-Trendy-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Create Trendy Content"></a>1. Create Trendy Content</h3><p> The simplest way to boost engagement levels on Facebook is by creating content that will trend. Whether it is a blog post, picture, video or even a meme, getting something trending can add a significant amount of followers to a page.</p><p> Companies can identify trending topics by seeing what is making the headlines at major sites, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" >Buzzfeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it shows the topics that people are talking about at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-followers-trendy-content.JPG"                      alt="Create Trendy Content"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email"></a>2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email</h3><p> If your company already has a significant email list for marketing purposes, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-social-email/" >targeting that email list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to boost Facebook follower counts is a great idea. When you send a newsletter to your mail list, make sure you add a call to action regarding Facebook.</p><p> Encourage them to like your page so they can get the latest updates, discounts and other valuable content! Even if you get a percentage of those on the email list to follower your account, it will be a great help as you attempt to boost your follower count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/email-increase-facebook-follower.JPG"                      alt="email increse facebook follower"                ></p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button"><a href="#3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Facebook Follow Button"></a>3. Use the Facebook Follow Button</h3><p> Companies would be surprised at the amount of users who want to check out their social media pages, but are not sure if they exist. When someone visits your website, there should be a clear button present to indicate you are on that social media platform.</p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/social-media-marketing/how-to-activate-the-follow-button-on-a-facebook-personal-profile/" >create your own Facebook follow button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you can place on various pages on your website. When users click on that button, they will go directly to your Facebook page. If they are already signed into the site, they just have to click the follow button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/follow-button.JPG"                      alt="facebook follow button"                ></p><h3 id="4-Create-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#4-Create-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Create Facebook Videos"></a>4. Create Facebook Videos</h3><p> Statistics show that videos get a lot more traction and response from users on Facebook. Showcasing interesting video content about your company, products or services is a great way to gain more followers.</p><p> A Facebook video should be short and sweet - getting to the point immediately. Videos could tease products and services, announce discounts, or offer a behind the scenes look at how the company is run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook video"                ></p><h3 id="5-Write-a-Great-Introduction"><a href="#5-Write-a-Great-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="5. Write a Great Introduction"></a>5. Write a Great Introduction</h3><p> Do not ignore the “About” section on your Facebook profile. When you fill in that section with all the relevant information, people will have an easier time seeing your page on search results pages.</p><p> Not only do you show up higher on Facebook searches, but also on Google search engine rankings. Information such as the company name, address, number, mission statement and other details should be included in the about section. The more people know, the better your profile comes across.</p><h3 id="6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post"><a href="#6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Hashtags to the Post"></a>6. Add Hashtags to the Post</h3><p> Many companies still associate hashtags with Twitter. But they have become a critical part of interacting on Facebook as well. When a person clicks on a hashtag or enters it in the search bar, they can see all relevant posts with that hashtag.</p><p> When you are attempting to create trending content, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >adding hashtags is a helpful way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get more people to notice and read your posts. Even people who do not follow your page will be able to see your posts, especially if they begin to trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-hashtag.JPG"                      alt="use hashtag increase follower"                ></p><h3 id="7-Try-Facebook-Live"><a href="#7-Try-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="7. Try Facebook Live"></a>7. Try Facebook Live</h3><p> Facebook Live offers a great opportunity for companies to live stream with their viewers, giving them personalized and behind the scenes access into operations.</p><p> When someone is following your page, they get a notification that you are in a live stream. They can even interact with the video with likes or by commenting. Live videos can also help build an audience as other people tune into your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live.JPG"                      alt="facebook live"                ></p><h3 id="8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers"><a href="#8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers"></a>8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers</h3><p> Do not be afraid to engage with your audience. A Facebook account is not just for status updates or company information. It is a place where you can directly connect with your audience.</p><p> Answering questions, providing clever replies and other ways of interaction can help make your brand feel more personal. You can also interact with influencers who have a huge follower count, especially if you already have a positive working relationship with those influencers.</p><h3 id="9-Post-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#9-Post-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="9.

You need to keep in mind that the maximum time limit for broadcasting on Facebook is 30 minutes.</p><p> 2. If you get trolled by other users while broadcasting or you don’t like the comments from a viewer then you can choose to block them from the broadcast. Just click on their profile pic which appears beside their comment and hit <strong>‘Block’</strong>.</p><p> 3. Before you go live on Facebook make sure that you have fast connection. Wi-fi works best for live broadcast on Facebook. If you don’t have wifi access then try using a 4G connection. Ideally you should check the speed of your net before you start broadcasting. For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.</p><p> 4. Once the broadcast is done the video is going to appear on your Facebook profile page and can be seen by your selected audience. However you can choose to remove the video at any time if your want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-choruscheck-live-audio-critique/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  ChorusCheck  Live Audio Critique</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-fb-rights-instant-video-ownership-takedown-questions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  FB Rights  Instant Video Ownership Takedown Questions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-frame-your-cinematic-tales-three-paths-for-instagram-borders/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Frame Your Cinematic Tales  Three Paths for Instagram Borders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-integrating-multimedia-elements-for-engaging-facebook-slideshows/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Integrating Multimedia Elements for Engaging Facebook Slideshows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-interactive-content-the-key-to-boosted-facebook-pages/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Interactive Content  The Key to Boosted Facebook Pages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tips-for-making-facebook-ad-videos-memorable/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Tips for Making Facebook Ad Videos Memorable</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlock-full-scale-viewing-on-facebook/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlock Full-Scale Viewing on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-simple-steps-to-update-your-networks-banner-image/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unveiling the Simple Steps to Update Your Network's Banner Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-choosing-the-best-footage-editor-hero-vs-polaroid-edition/"><u>[New] Choosing the Best Footage Editor  Hero Vs.
