You can stream movies, TV shows, listen to podcasts, and music from Apple Music and Pandora.</p><p>Apple TV comes in different models to bring innovation and advanced features for its loyal customers.

Thus, it is important to create a video that can force viewers to make quick decision about whether this particular video must be watched or not. In order to leave the best impression on viewer’s mind, every video ad must have two major characteristics: It should not have length more than 20 seconds, content must be capable enough to catch attention within first 2, 3 seconds. Here are few common mistakes for low rating of certain videos ads:</p><ul><li>They have long annoying intro at the beginning.</li><li>Credits or logos are added at beginning portion.</li><li>Sometimes they follow too big story.</li></ul><p> It is good to show your viewers what they are curious to watch, create videos as per the taste of your targeted audience.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail"><a href="#2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="2.

When lower thirds are added to the videos then viewers can easily go ahead with your content and pick the major details. Although, this information is named as Lower Thirds but these messages can be placed at any portion of your video ad screen. The key is to work with your favourite video editing program that can add text impressively.</p><h4 id="5-Include-a-Compelling-Offer"><a href="#5-Include-a-Compelling-Offer" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Compelling Offer"></a>5. Include a Compelling Offer</h4><p> Your ads are of no use if they cannot create a compelling offer for viewers. It must include a call to action. The idea is to add a offer that viewers cannot resists and never forget to track links on your video ad using UTM codes as they can help you to know the rating and impact of your video.

While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings-2"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.

Hashtags Connect Your Content"></a>1. Hashtags Connect Your Content</h3><p> The reason why it is so useful to use hashtags on Facebook is because they will help you connect your content with other people who may be interested in what you have to say. It is likely that other people are posting about similar topics, products or services.</p><p> Hashtags lets you form a connection with those people. Your content is easily accessible with hashtags, as anyone who is browsing through the current posts on that hashtag will see your posts.</p><h3 id="2-Expand-Your-Reach-3"><a href="#2-Expand-Your-Reach-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Expand Your Reach"></a>2. Expand Your Reach</h3><p> Using hashtags is a win-win approach on Facebook. There is no downside associated with adding a couple hashtags to every Facebook post. And the upside is huge.</p><p> A hashtag delivers expanded reach on the platform. A previous post would only be seen by followers or those who specifically search for your business name on the platform. Hashtags ensure that anyone clicking on a hashtag and browsing through the feed may come across your content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags"></a>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</h2><p> Hashtags are a concept that first started on Twitter, where individuals were able to add a # before writing a word or phrase. The hashtag is a searchable device on these social media platforms, as a person is able to click on the hashtag and see other posts that include it as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >Every hashtag that is created on Facebook has its own URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When someone clicks on the hashtag, they immediately go to that page, where they can see other posts from the same hashtag.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly"></a>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Popular-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Popular-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Popular Hashtags"></a>1. Use Popular Hashtags</h3><p> The first rule to succeeding with hashtags is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamtechie.com/2013/05/an-update-on-facebook-and-hashtags/" >use ones that are already very popular <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance-3"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross Social Performance"></a>2. Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events-3"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful.

Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011. In this article, we are going to provide screen recording solutions for Facebook video call and chat recording on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS platforms, and we’ll show you how you can easily record video calls on Facebook.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Record Facebook Video Call on iPhone or iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android devices</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS"><a href="#Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS"></a>Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</h2><p>There are many different ways to record a Facebook video call on a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Macbook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or PC, but only a few of them are more efficient than using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Video Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files. The software also enables you to capture videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card.

Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format-3"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

Another could be that it offers a clean and user-friendly interface.</p><p>SnapDownloader also allows users to download videos from Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. There’s no need to limit yourself to a program that only lets you download videos when you can instead choose one that has an in-built video cutter and converter.

Schedule the videos to be downloaded at a set time or queue videos on your video download list, so you don’t have to wait for the download to be complete and manually enter the link.</p><p>At the same time, you can trim the video to the length of your choice.

It’s capable of downloading videos up to 8K in resolution. You can also enjoy other video qualities like 4k, Ultra HD, 1080p, and more. It also works incredibly swiftly. The convenience and speed are two major reasons to download this Facebook video downloader in mp4. Another could be that it offers a clean and user-friendly interface.</p><p>SnapDownloader also allows users to download videos from Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. There’s no need to limit yourself to a program that only lets you download videos when you can instead choose one that has an in-built video cutter and converter. You can download videos in various output formats, including mp4, avi, mp3, m4a, and more.</p><p>One benefit of using snap downloader is its built-in web browser that lets users download private videos, playlists, and content that generally need you to be logged in.</p><p>What better way to expedite the video download capabilities than with the “One-Click Mode.” This mode allows you to save your videos in your preferred format and output as a premium feature.

Schedule the videos to be downloaded at a set time or queue videos on your video download list, so you don’t have to wait for the download to be complete and manually enter the link.</p><p>At the same time, you can trim the video to the length of your choice.

This will let you search for the particular live stream you’re looking for. Please note that you can watch the video to your heart’s content. You will not interact with the video through emoji reactions or comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-2.png"                      alt="access facebook live with video url"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select The Watch (TV) Icon</strong></p><p>You’ll notice a row of icons at the top of the Facebook page. From those icons, select an icon that looks like a small tv. This icon will take you to the section with live streams and edited videos for upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-3.png"                      alt="use watch to catch facebook live streams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on the Live tab.</strong></p><p>An alternative to that step is to click on the Live tab. You can find the live tab on the left-hand side panel. This opens a new page where you can watch live videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-4.png"                      alt="click on the live tab on facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Look for the Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-5.png"                      alt="use menu to watch facebook live"                ></p><p>You can also tap on the ‘Menu,’ indicated by nine dots. This will open a drop-down menu where you can scroll down. Select ‘watch’ to take you to the live stream page you want to see.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png"                      alt="use menu to look for live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams</strong></p><p>Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red ‘Live’ tab on the top left corner.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Communicate on Chat</strong></p><p>You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You’ll be back on the ‘Watch’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-8.png"                      alt="exit live stream on facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen.

With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily.

This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can.

You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream.

How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?"></a>Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?</h2><p>The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png"                      alt="use watch icon to find videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Find Live Tab</strong></p><p>Below the ‘Watch’ tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?"></a>Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?</h2><p>The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png"                      alt="use watch icon to find videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Find Live Tab</strong></p><p>Below the ‘Watch’ tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone</h2><p>You can also watch Facebook live on your iPhone. The steps are broadly similar to Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app</strong></p><p>You can log into the Facebook app. iPhones also support your ability to view live streams on browsers. You can watch the live on your mobile browser. However, you won’t be able to interact with the video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Find the Menu</strong></p><p>Look for the three horizontal lines icon. This is the ‘Menu’ icon on the bottom right. Tap on this icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="Find menu on iphone facebook app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap on ‘Live videos’</strong></p><p>Select the ‘Live videos’ icons. This will take you to the list of videos currently streamed live. You can find your creator’s video there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="use live to search for videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Specific Videos</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-14.png"                      alt="use menu to search for videos"                ></p><p>You can look for a specific video or even a specific topic. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. You can search according to the name or phrase. Use filters to manage your results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-15.png"                      alt="use menu to search for videos"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-TV-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-TV-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
