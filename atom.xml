To ensure that you can share your videos seamlessly and quickly, we have listed all the steps below. So, Let’s begin:</p><p><strong>1. Open TikTok:</strong></p><p>Tap on the TikTok app on your iPhone or iPad to open it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Open TikTok"                ></p><p><strong>2. Select the Video:</strong></p><p>Now, in the next step, you need to select the video you want to share. You can share any video from the discover page, newsfeed, and a user’s profile.</p><p><strong>3. Share The Video:</strong></p><p>Click on the video to start playing it. Once the video is playing, you will spot a small white arrow on the right side. Click on the arrow to share the TikTok video to Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share The Video"                ></p><p><strong>4. Select Facebook from the share options:</strong></p><p>Now, the iPhone will give you options for the apps you want to share the video with. Tap on Facebook to share the video to Facebook.</p><p>Once you tap on the Facebook icon, you will be prompted to open Facebook if you are sharing from TikTok to Facebook for the first time. Click on Open to continue.</p><p>The Facebook App will now open, and your selected TikTok video will be shown on the new post screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="Select Facebook from the share options"                ></p><p><strong>5. Select where you want to post:</strong></p><p>At the top of the screen, you will see the words “Your Timeline”. Tap on it to change where you want to post the video. You can choose to post it in a group, a friend’s timeline, or Facebook newsfeed.</p><p>In case you are also managing a page, you can also post the video there by selecting your page. This will post the video on the page’s timeline.</p><p><strong>6. Add a caption for your video:</strong></p><p>To add a caption to your post, tap on the “Say something about this” box and write whatever you like. You can also add your location, add emojis or customize your post before posting.</p><p><strong>7. Tap the Share :</strong></p><p>Now tap on the Share button on the top right corner to share the video with your friends.</p><p>An important point to note here is that if you have chosen the destination as your timeline, you will be prompted to select if you want to post the TikTok to your Facebook story or Facebook Newsfeed. Select the option you want and then click on Share Now.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-YouShare-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-without-Watermark"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-YouShare-Tik-Tok-Videos-to-Facebook-without-Watermark" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark"></a>Part 3: How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark</h2><p>While sometimes you might share videos from TikTok to Facebook, other times you might want to post the same video on Facebook without linking it back to your TikTok account. This is especially useful if you are going to post the same video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts.</p><p>However, this can be a bit tricky with the TikTok watermark over the video. But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account. Let’s dive right in:</p><h3 id="To-Remove-Watermark-from-Tiktok-Videos-on-iPhone-and-Android"><a href="#To-Remove-Watermark-from-Tiktok-Videos-on-iPhone-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android"></a>To Remove Watermark from Tiktok Videos on iPhone and Android</h3><p>Most software these days only allow you to remove watermarks in their premium versions, where you might have to pay some extra bucks to avail that feature. But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.</p><p>The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.</p><p>1. Download the <a class="link"   href="https://www.apowersoft.com/record-all-screen" >ApowerREC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your phone and launch it.</p><p>2. Tap on the settings icon in the button on the right corner of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Tap on the settings icon"                ></p><p>3. Make sure you have turned on the Recording Overlay and Screenshot overlay. This will help you to record and take a screenshot of the video simultaneously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Turned on the Recording Overlay"                ></p><p>4. By default, TikTok videos are in a vertical format, so you would need to set the recording in the portrait style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-6.jpg"                      alt="Set the recording in the portrait style"                ></p><p>5. Start the recording now to record the video. If you want to take screenshots of the video, click on the camera icon towards the left edge of your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-7.jpg"                      alt="Click on the camera icon"                ></p><p>6. To discover other options while you record the video, you can tap on the overlay button. This will give you the option to pause, stop or hide the menu. You can even add an image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Tap on the overlay button"                ></p><p>7. Stop the Recording when you are finished. You will then find the recorded video in the ApowerRec app, and now you can preview it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/share-tiktok-videos-to-facebook-9.jpg"                      alt="Stop the Recording"                ></p><p>8. Once you have recorded the video without a watermark, the next step is to share it on your social media. ApowerREC allows you to share those recordings directly to Facebook from the app.</p><p>And voila! You have done it. You have shared a TikTok video to Facebook without the hassle of a watermark.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-Watermark-from-Videos-on-PC"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Watermark-from-Videos-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Watermark from Videos on PC"></a>How to Remove Watermark from Videos on PC</h3><p>If you want to record and edit videos on your PC, then we recommend that you use Wondershare Democreator.

But, do not worry, we have got you covered. We will guide you in detail on how to remove a watermark from a video and then share it to your Facebook account.

But Apowersoft Recorder allows you to do that for free.</p><p>The software is extremely easy to use, and you can remove any text, logos, or unnecessary objects from your video. You can save the video from TikTok without the logo and username on it. Just follow the simple steps below to remove watermarks from your video.</p><p>1.

The key to success is using a structure that appeals to your audience and helps you to get your message across.</p><p>In this article, we’ll outline three simple structures that you can use for your Facebook Ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-ads-copywriting-structure.jpg"                      alt="facebook ads copywriting structure"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Creative-Image"><a href="#What-is-Creative-Image" class="headerlink" title="What is Creative Image"></a>What is Creative Image</h2><p>A creative image is essential for any effective Facebook ad. You want to create an image that catches the reader’s eye and makes them interested in learning more about your product or service. There are a few things to keep in mind when creating your image:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality images that are eye-catching and relevant to your product or service.</li><li>Make sure your text is easy to read, and avoid overcrowding your image with too much information.</li><li>Make sure your branding is consistent across all of your marketing materials.</li><li>Keep your target audience in mind when creating your image.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads"></a>Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you need to make a creative image before running a Facebook an Ad:</p><p>First, an eye-catching image will help to grab the reader’s attention and make them more likely to read your ad.</p><p>Second, including relevant images with your ad will help to illustrate your product or service and make it easier for your audience to understand what you’re selling.</p><p>And finally, having consistent branding across all of your marketing materials will help to create a professional image for your business.</p><h2 id="Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post"><a href="#Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post" class="headerlink" title="Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post"></a>Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post</h2><p>A Facebook post is simply a message that you post on your Facebook page. A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people’s Facebook pages. There are a few key differences between Facebook posts and ads:</p><ul><li>Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.</li><li>Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.</li><li>Facebook ads can include more information than posts, including clickable links and images.</li><li>Facebook ads will always be shown in the News Feed, while Facebook posts may not be seen by all of your followers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-feeds.jpg"                      alt="facebook feeds"                ></p><p>Now that you know the difference between a Facebook post and an ad, let’s take a look at how to create an effective ad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-effective-facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="create effective facebook ads"                ></p><h2 id="The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures"><a href="#The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures" class="headerlink" title="The Three Simple Copywriting Structures"></a>The Three Simple Copywriting Structures</h2><p><strong>#1. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

You can now bid goodbye to the days of expressing yourself only through the generic thumbs up, happy, sad, or angry emojis on Facebook. Wondering how? Well, with the new Facebook avatar, you can now create your cartoonish characters, set it as your profile picture, and share it with others.</p><p>Recently, the social media giant rolled out its Avatar feature for users in the US. At a time when the 15-year-old social networking platform seems increasingly uncool and drab to the current generation, this new feature can make it feel more youthful, visually communicative and fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-facebook-avatar.jpg"                      alt="What Is Facebook Avatar"                ></p><p>source：edition.cnn.com</p><p>Can’t wait to try out this new feature, isn’t it?

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite"><a href="#Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji.

But how can you make sure that your Page is seen by as many people as possible? And how can you make sure that it appears at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs)?</p><p>Here are a few simple steps that you can take to improve your Facebook Page’s visibility and rank it higher in the SERPs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up"><a href="#Part-1-Make-sure-your-Facebook-Page-is-properly-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up"></a>Part 1. Make sure your Facebook Page is properly set up</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/set-up-facebook-page-properly.jpg"                      alt="set up facebook page properly"                ></p><p>Facebook is a powerful marketing tool for businesses, and a properly set-up page can help you to rank higher in search results and reach more potential customers.</p><p>To start with, make sure that your page includes all of the essential information, such as your business name, address, and contact information. Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.</p><p>Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you’ll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.</p><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description"><a href="#Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Of course, you don’t want to stuff your title and description with keywords - that will just make your Page look spammy. Instead, focus on using a few key phrases that accurately describe what your Page is all about. And make sure that those phrases are prominently featured in both your title and description.</p><p>With a little keyword optimization, you can help ensure that your Facebook page ranks high in search results - and that more people see and engage with your content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-Page-on-other-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

And when it comes to Facebook, one of the best ways to get more exposure for your Page is to promote it on other social media platforms.</p><p>By sharing your Page on Twitter, Instagram, and other sites, you can reach a wider audience and encourage more people to like and follow your Page. Additionally, you can also use paid advertising on social media to target potential customers and get your Page in front of them.</p><p>When done correctly, promoting your Facebook Page on other social media platforms can be a great way to increase your ranking and get more visibility for your business.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly"><a href="#Part-4-Add-fresh-relevant-content-regularly" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This not only keeps your page active and engaging, but it also helps Facebook’s algorithms to see your page as valuable and worth promoting. Of course, posting quality content can be a challenge, especially if you’re running a busy page.</p><p>However, there are a few simple strategies you can use to make sure your content is always top-notch. First, try to vary the types of content you post, mixing up text posts, photos, and videos. Second, take advantage of trending topics and hashtags to ensure your content is timely and relevant.</p><p>Finally, don’t be afraid to ask your fans for input - after all, they’re the ones who are most likely to engage with your content! By following these simple tips, you can keep your Facebook ranking high while also providing value for your fans.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress"><a href="#Part-5-Monitor-your-Page’s-analytics-to-track-its-progress" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

This will give you a clear picture of how your page is performing and where it needs to improve. There are a number of different metrics you should be tracking, including your page views, likes, and shares.</p><p>By monitoring these metrics, you’ll be able to see which content is resonating with your audience and which content isn’t. You can also use this data to adjust your content strategy and ensure that your page is consistently delivering high-quality content that helps it rank.</p><p>So, if you’re looking to make your Facebook page rank, start by monitoring your page’s analytics.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Ask-your-followers-to-recommend-your-Page-to-their-friends"><a href="#Part-6-Ask-your-followers-to-recommend-your-Page-to-their-friends" class="headerlink" title="Part 6.

If your followers are happy with your content, they’ll be more than happy to recommend your Page to their friends.</p><p>And the more people who Like and follow your Page, the higher it will rank in Facebook’s algorithms. That means that your content will be more likely to show up in people’s News Feeds, and you’ll get more opportunities to engage with potential customers.</p><p>So, if you’re looking to give your Facebook Page a boost, just ask your followers to recommend it to their friends. It’s a simple request that can have a big impact on your reach and engagement.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook Page is seen by more people and ranks higher on the SERPs.

When you pin a song, it will be added to your profile. You can pin one song at a time, though. To do that, follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook page and log in using your Facebook credentials. Please remember that this feature is only available for smartphones and iPad.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your profile page and locate the Music tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the Music option.

And it’s pretty apparent that after adding a song to your profile picture, you will like to hear it out as well. So, here’s how you can listen to the added song.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your Facebook profile on your smartphone or tab and go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once again, go to the Music option and click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see all songs that you have added to your profile. Click on any of the songs to listen to it. Moreover, you can click on any song to listen to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-history-list.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music History"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Remove-Unwanted-Music-from-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Remove-Unwanted-Music-from-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?</h2><p>Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that. Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right.

And it’s pretty apparent that after adding a song to your profile picture, you will like to hear it out as well. So, here’s how you can listen to the added song.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your Facebook profile on your smartphone or tab and go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once again, go to the Music option and click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see all songs that you have added to your profile.

For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile-3"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that. Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right. Moreover, you can choose a song according to your mood and add it to your profile to reflect on your current feeling. The good part about the Music feature is that it has billions of songs ready to be added to your profile. No matter what kind of music you like or which singer you listen to, Facebook will have them all.</p><p>Now that you have learned <strong>how to add a song to your Facebook profile</strong> try it out yourself and add your favorite songs to your profile to impress everyone.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                > </a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-simplifying-the-process-of-video-integration-on-instagram/"><u>In 2024, Simplifying the Process of Video Integration on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-full-potential-watching-facebook-videos-on-your-apple-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking Full Potential  Watching Facebook Videos on Your Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-seeking-clarity-complete-accessibility-of-mutual-shared-materials/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Seeking Clarity  Complete Accessibility of Mutual Shared Materials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-seize-your-social-media-videos-top-extensions-and-downloaders-for-firefox/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Seize Your Social Media Videos!

The section reflects on methods to eliminate the problem from its roots.</p><h3 id="For-PC-Users"><a href="#For-PC-Users" class="headerlink" title="For PC Users"></a>For PC Users</h3><p>If you are a Chrome user on Windows, follow the three methods designed for you.</p><p><strong>Method 1: Clearing the Browsing Data and Cache</strong></p><p>The first fix to make Facebook video run in full screen revolves around clearing the browsing data and cache. There are no strings attached to this method. The process is as simple as it can get. The steps include:</p><p>Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on “Settings” from the context menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="access chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: The “Settings” will open. Hit “Privacy and Security” and then “Clear Browsing Data.” Select the desired time range and tick mark all options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on clear browsing data"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press “Clear Data,” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="clear your browser data"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>The browser extensions are often added to work effectively. But they do not work all the time and create problems for the normal workability of the Facebook app. Disabling the browser extensions is the right way to clear the <strong>FB full-screen problem.</strong> The steps are:</p><p>Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on “Settings” and then head-to-head to the “Extensions” from “Main Tools.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-5.jpg"                      alt="open chrome extensions"                ></p><p>Step 2: Disable the extensions by toggling them off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-6.jpg"                      alt="disable your chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3: Disabling Hardware Acceleration</strong></p><p>The enabled Hardware Acceleration enhances the operation of different programs used on the browser. However, it does interfere with Facebook usage and video previews. It is smart to disable the Hardware Acceleration and then find out if the problem was resolved.</p><p>Step 1: Open your Chrome browser and click on “Settings” from the three vertical dots. Click on “Advanced” from the left panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-7.jpg"                      alt="tap on chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: Toggle off “Use Hardware Acceleration when available,” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-8.jpg"                      alt="disable hardware acceleration"                ></p><h3 id="For-Mobile-Users"><a href="#For-Mobile-Users" class="headerlink" title="For Mobile Users"></a>For Mobile Users</h3><p>If you are a smartphone user facing <strong>Facebook full-screen video problem,</strong> we understand your concern.

Possible Reasons for Facebook Video Icon Missing"></a>Part 1. Possible Reasons for Facebook Video Icon Missing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-icon-missing-1.png"                      alt="Facebook Video Icon in Shortcuts Bar"                ></p><p>The Watch video icon tab is a very useful option in Facebook. Using this feature, you can quickly and easily watch your favorite videos and movies online on the platform. Since it provides free access, people enjoy and prefer this social media site a lot. You’ll a lot of fun watching interesting video content here.</p><p>But what is there is no TV icon on Facebook video? Well, there could be so many reasons behind this, and the most common ones are discussed below:</p><p><strong>Reason 1: You’ve not updated your Facebook application.</strong></p><p>An outdated application may lack some of the latest features. So, if this is the case, make sure you update the app asap to access this interesting feature.</p><p><strong>Reason 2: It’s been a long time since you deleted your Facebook data on your computer.</strong></p><p>Cached data can cause problems accessing the latest apps, data, and features on your device. So, delete the old data, and then see the difference.</p><p><strong>Reason 3: If you’re a new user of Facebook, you do not get the option to enable the Watch Video tab.</strong></p><p>Many new users find difficulty accessing the problem. In such cases, you can approach online help guides and videos to know how to add the Facebook video icon when you access the platform on your device.</p><p><strong>Reason 4: You’ve not updated the software of your device.</strong></p><p>Much like an outdated application, it’s important to update the software or operating system of your smartphone, PC, or laptop. An outdated app may not support advanced features like a Facebook video icon. So, update the software of your device asap.</p><p><strong>Reason 5: Your phone’s screen or display is too small to see the icon.</strong></p><p>No tv icon on Facebook video could be because the tiny display of your device hides many icons and features. So, you may need to scroll down and up a lot if this is the case.</p><p><strong>Reason 6:</strong> Finally, in order to see the Facebook video icon, you may have to disable another icon in the shortcut bar. Once you’ve done this, only then can you add this icon back on it.</p><p>These are the most common reasons when you see Facebook video icon missing. Fortunately, you can fix most of these problems yourself because these are not major ones.</p><p>But in some cases, for example, when you don’t know Facebook settings, you’ve to go for alternative solutions.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-No-TV-Icon-on-Facebook-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-No-TV-Icon-on-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook"></a>Part 2: Bonus Tip! Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook</h2><p>As mentioned above, Facebook operates on a list of standards which include specific dimensions, sizes, aspect ratios, and video length. If the user fails to follow these video specs, the video wouldn’t upload and will create complications. There are different specs for story videos, 360 videos, news feed, and Carousel video ads.</p><p>The standards have been set for a frictionless process. For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 – 9:16. Similarly, the resolution should be 1080*1920 px, with a maximum file size of 4GB, and video length should be within 1 to 15 seconds.</p><p>There is a diverse range of video formats successfully applicable on Facebook. Most beginners and even advanced users don’t know the formats. Henceforth, the sub-section has taken the opportunity to mention those formats other than MP4 and MOV.</p><ul><li>MP4 (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>MPE (MPEG video)</li><li>MPEG (MPEG video)</li><li>MPEG4 (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>M2TS (M2TS video)</li><li>M4V (MPEG-4 video)</li><li>MKV (Matroska format)</li><li>MOD (MOD video)</li><li>MOV (QuickTime movie)</li><li>MPG (MPEG video)</li><li>MTS (AVCHD video)</li><li>DIVX (DIVX video)</li><li>OGV (Ogg video format)</li><li>QT (QuickTime movie)</li><li>TOD (TOD video)</li><li>TS (MPEG transport stream)</li><li>VOB (DVD video)</li><li>WMV (Windows Media Video)</li><li>DV (DV video)</li><li>F4V (Flash video)</li><li>FLV (Flash video)</li><li>GIF (graphics interchange format)</li><li>NSV (Nullsoft video)</li><li>OGM (Ogg media format)</li><li>3G2 (mobile video)</li><li>3GP (mobile video)</li><li>3GPP (mobile video)</li><li>ASF (Windows Media video)</li><li>AVI (AVI video)</li><li>DAT (MPEG video)</li></ul><h2 id="Closing-Words-3"><a href="#Closing-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Closing Words"></a>Closing Words</h2><p>Facebook influencers and business owners need to work hard for brand awareness and visibility, done with different media types. The product descriptions are presented in videos; however, to upload them on Facebook, it is necessary to consider the format.</p><p>Hence, the article focused on the best three <strong>MP4 to FB</strong> converters to <strong>convert MP4 to Facebook cover video.</strong> The step-by-step guide of using the converters was also highlighted in detail. The last section covered some formats that Facebook accepts. The users are recommended to know them to continue creating impeccable content and engaging the audience.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
