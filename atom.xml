Nowadays any iOS user can take stunning 360 degree photos on their iPhone and iPad and upload them directly on Facebook. If you are an iPhone user who is wondering how to create 360 degree photos and videos should keep reading this article where we are going to explain you everything about capturing 360 degrees pictures and videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB"><a href="#How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB"></a>How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB</h2><p> The introduction of a variety of VR headsets along with a range of cameras with 360 degree video shooting ability is a clear indicator of the fact that the future lies with Virtual Reality. However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash"><a href="#Splash" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano. Insta360 Nano which is available for less than $200 on Amazon is one of the cheapest devices for capturing real cool 360 degree videos. It can also be used as a standalone 360 degree cam which just needs to be connected with your iPhone for viewing your captures, tweaking the settings and for getting a live preview.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone</h4><ul><li>To capture a video&#x2F;photo just connect the Insta360 Nano to your iPhone via lightning.</li><li>Now launch the app and hit the shutter button to shoot.

Since Facebook itself does the job of stitching your 360 degree video together, uploading it can take quite some time. Usually a 20 second clip takes about 5-10 minutes to upload. Your video would appear with a 360 logo on the newsfeed of your friends so as to encourage viewers to enjoy this new 360 degree experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> The advent of VR headset along with the ability to upload videos and 360 photos on Facebook has created a new craze for 360 degree photos.

However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash-2"><a href="#Splash-2" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone-2"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone-2" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens-2"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens-2" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano.

This article directs readers to a guide on how to <strong>stream 1080p Facebook</strong> without any glitches.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">How to Enable A Facebook HD 1080p Stream?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Schedule A Facebook HD 1080p Stream?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Add Polls to Facebook 1080p Stream</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="#step4">Add Thumbnail to Facebook 1080p Stream</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Enable-A-Facebook-HD-1080p-Stream-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Enable-A-Facebook-HD-1080p-Stream-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Enable A Facebook HD 1080p Stream?"></a>Part 1: How to Enable A Facebook HD 1080p Stream?</h2><p><strong>Facebook 1080p stream</strong> provides content creators with an avenue of excellence. This potentially helps them feature exceptional results across their stream and keep their viewers happy with the quality that is being prospectively displayed across it. However, before creators lead towards their stream, an essential requirement needs to be looked into.</p><p>Streaming in HD is only possible if the user sends 1080p from their side. If, by any chance, the stream is 720p, Facebook would be unable to provide 1080p quality across its output. Uniformity is extremely important before guiding towards quality. Facebook allows users to select their choice for the live streaming software. Although the platform can be directly utilized for this purpose, several other software is supported throughout the live stream.</p><p>Users can consider using OBS Studio, Wirecast, or XSplit to cater to their streaming requirements. Facebook allows its users to consider any of the software mentioned above for their purpose. For going into a live stream, the user can consider going from a profile, Facebook page, group, or event. With diversity in selecting the source for going live, users can consider going live by sharing their screen, game, or external camera as the video resource.</p><p>Before going to <strong>stream 1080p Facebook,</strong> you might need to enable stream settings for your account. To carry this out, you are advised to look into the following steps in detail.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by going to the following link <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/live/create" >https://www.facebook.com/live/create <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Proceed by clicking on “Create Live Stream” to move into the Live Stream options of Facebook. Now, select the option of “Go Live.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stream-in-hd-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on create live stream"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On opening the dashboard, you may need to select the source for the video. Considering you are going to stream from another software, tap on the “Streaming Software” option. You can find the “Stream Key” across the option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stream-in-hd-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="access your stream key"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On clicking the “Advanced settings” option, a drop-down appears showing the “Server URL” for the stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stream-in-hd-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="scroll down to server url"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> As you obtain these keys and URLs for the stream, you need to proceed with the settings for the stream in your streaming software. Initially, you are advised to set the Encoder Settings for your stream. Set the ‘Rate Control’ to CB4, ‘Keyframe Interval’ to 2, and ‘B-frames’ to 3 for optimum results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stream-in-hd-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="adjust your encoder settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Before starting the stream, you need to select the 1080p options within the video quality for the stream.

Every young and old person uses various social media platforms. They could use these platforms to either connect with someone or maybe for entertainment purposes. In any case, we are always attracted by the videos we come across. Most of the time, we watch and enjoy the complete videos as they maintain our interest.</p><p>Rarely do we not watch the complete video. This only happens when the video fails to sustain your interest. This is commonly observed, and people complain that the <strong>Facebook video is partially muted.</strong> There are multiple reasons why <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> on Facebook. If you want to learn more about this, then stay with us.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip: How to Create Facebook Video with Music using Filmora to Avoid Copyright Issue?</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How to Mute Facebook Videos?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Video-Partially-Muted-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Video-Partially-Muted-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?</h2><p>Adding background music to your Facebook videos has its own significance. It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted</strong>?</p><p>You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos. Let us share the reasons with you that why your <strong>video is partially muted</strong> on Facebook.</p><h3 id="1-Video-Gets-Reported"><a href="#1-Video-Gets-Reported" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Gets Reported"></a>1. Video Gets Reported</h3><p>One factor that aids in your <strong>Facebook video partially muted</strong> is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then <strong>your video is partially muted.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music"><a href="#2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music"></a>2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music</h3><p>Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.</p><p>If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either <strong>your video is partially muted on Facebook</strong>, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.</p><h3 id="3-Someone-Else’s-Music"><a href="#3-Someone-Else’s-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Someone Else’s Music"></a>3. Someone Else’s Music</h3><p>If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?"></a>Part 2. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?</h2><p>It is not at all shocking to see that with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted.</strong> This mostly happens because of the strict and non-flexible policies that Facebook has. The question here arises that what could be done in a situation where <strong>Facebook video partially muted?</strong></p><p>The coming section of this article will bring all the answers to you. We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.</p><h3 id="1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video"><a href="#1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button. This is because you have the right to use the stock files in your videos.</p><h3 id="2-If-Video-is-Muted"><a href="#2-If-Video-is-Muted" class="headerlink" title="2. If Video is Muted"></a>2. If Video is Muted</h3><p>Another scenario is where you have posted a video on Facebook, but it has been muted, or Facebook partially removes music from your video. A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments”.</p><p>This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-2.jpg"                      alt="restore facebook video audio"                ></p><h3 id="3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed"><a href="#3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed" class="headerlink" title="3. In Case if Video has been Removed"></a>3. In Case if Video has been Removed</h3><p>There are chances that Facebook might even remove your entire video from Facebook due to any kind of copyright claim. Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.</p><p>If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should ‘Dispute the Claimed Identity.’ You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Then from the menu screen, scroll down to locate ‘Settings &amp; Privacy.’ After it has been navigated, then from the drop-down menu, you should select the ‘Settings’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-3.jpg"                      alt="access facebook audio settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Look-for-Media-and-Contacts"><a href="#Step-2-Look-for-Media-and-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Look for Media and Contacts"></a>Step 2: Look for Media and Contacts</h3><p>A new menu will open in front of you.

Reasons for Facebook Suggested Videos Not Showing Up"></a>Part 1. Reasons for Facebook Suggested Videos Not Showing Up</h2><p>Facebook has various tabs and features that the user can access and use. Facebook has a Feed that is always full of fun stuff, your friend’s status and life updates, etc. You can also message, call and video call your loved ones who are far away from you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-1.jpg"                      alt="reasons for suggested videos not showing up"                ></p><p>There is another section on Facebook that holds a variety of videos. The section keeps an eye on you. It only consists of videos for fun and entertainment. It has been reported sometimes that the <strong>Facebook suggested videos not showing up.</strong> In any such scenario, we always figure out a way to watch the videos, but no one bothers to know about the reasoning factors that have caused this problem.</p><p>In this section of the article, we will highlight the various reasons why Facebook suggested videos are not showing up.</p><h3 id="1-Improper-Launching"><a href="#1-Improper-Launching" class="headerlink" title="1. Improper Launching"></a>1. Improper Launching</h3><p>One resulting factor that might cause your <strong>Facebook suggested videos not to show up</strong> is the improper launch of the application.

You are suggested to follow the given solutions for this particular problem because you never know what might work for you. First of all, you should log out from Facebook, and you can also delete the browser completely. After that, you should install it fresh. You should also restart your system. Then give it some time to work properly.</p><h3 id="2-Poor-Network-Signals"><a href="#2-Poor-Network-Signals" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Network Signals"></a>2. Poor Network Signals</h3><p>A very common reason observed for <strong>FB suggested videos not showing up</strong> is the weak connection. This is the most accurate reason for many Facebook problems. Not just this issue but with poor network signals, you might also face some other troubles.</p><p>The best thing to tackle this problem is selecting a good and strong connection environment. With this solution, you can avoid many other problems as well, including this problem. With a stronger network connection, refresh the page because it increases the chance to view the videos.</p><h3 id="3-Insufficient-Space"><a href="#3-Insufficient-Space" class="headerlink" title="3. Insufficient Space"></a>3. Insufficient Space</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, there is a complete section of random entertaining videos. It consists of hundreds of videos that it has to buffer at once. Facebook videos need buffering to get played, and for that, they require quite the space.</p><p>If you don’t have sufficient space, this might be the resulting factor for <strong>Facebook suggested videos not showing up.</strong> This is the reason that causes the delay in loading the videos on time.</p><h3 id="4-Cache-problems"><a href="#4-Cache-problems" class="headerlink" title="4. Cache problems"></a>4. Cache problems</h3><p>A corrupt cache is another big reason why your Fb suggested videos don’t show up. Cache or even the cookies also slow down the performance of your favorite application. As with corrupt cache and cookies, the application does not work like it usually works efficiently.</p><p>For this scenario, the suggested solution is to stop Facebook forcefully. Once that is done, now it’s time to clear and empty the cache for applications’ better performance.</p><h3 id="5-Update-Required"><a href="#5-Update-Required" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can easily access that tab and enjoy and entertain yourself with those videos. We also mentioned that this video section keeps an eye on you.</p><p>The coming section of this article will walk you through several factors on the basis on which the suggested videos are displayed. Let’s get started.</p><h3 id="1-Videos-Popularity"><a href="#1-Videos-Popularity" class="headerlink" title="1. Videos Popularity"></a>1. Videos Popularity</h3><p>The number 1 reason that how could some random videos make their way to your suggested videos is the popularity of any particular video. If you find any unusual video in your videos section, then the first thing that should come to your mind is that the video is popular all over Facebook and the internet.</p><p>Any video that offers entertainment, good and quality content, motivation quotes or speech, some kind of love-hate poetry. Even compilation videos of different sports, matches, funny moments, and a lot more things can fall in this category that gets the fame.</p><p>So, any famous or trending video that a lot of Facebook users have viewed, shared, liked, or commented on will automatically make its way to your and others’ suggested video tab.

People and Pages You Follow"></a>2. People and Pages You Follow</h3><p>Another factor that aids in bringing random videos to your Facebook suggested videos section is whom you follow and like. Like the real world, Facebook is that platform where every person has their own identify, their accounts. Every business, different startups have their pages. Influencers have pages from where they can spread their voice through their content.</p><p>Being Facebook users, we follow different pages and follow different people as well. We add different friends on Facebook as it is the social media platform that aims to provide connectivity. So hence, in simple words, we are surrounded by many different personalities who have entirely different approaches, preferences, likes, and dislikes.</p><p>Several videos in your suggested video section come from the people and pages you are surrounded by. The pages and people whom you follow there liked and viewed videos end up in your videos section too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Customize-the-Suggested-Videos-Yourself"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Customize-the-Suggested-Videos-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The section reflects on methods to eliminate the problem from its roots.</p><h3 id="For-PC-Users"><a href="#For-PC-Users" class="headerlink" title="For PC Users"></a>For PC Users</h3><p>If you are a Chrome user on Windows, follow the three methods designed for you.</p><p><strong>Method 1: Clearing the Browsing Data and Cache</strong></p><p>The first fix to make Facebook video run in full screen revolves around clearing the browsing data and cache. There are no strings attached to this method. The process is as simple as it can get. The steps include:</p><p>Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on “Settings” from the context menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="access chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: The “Settings” will open. Hit “Privacy and Security” and then “Clear Browsing Data.” Select the desired time range and tick mark all options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on clear browsing data"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press “Clear Data,” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="clear your browser data"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>The browser extensions are often added to work effectively. But they do not work all the time and create problems for the normal workability of the Facebook app. Disabling the browser extensions is the right way to clear the <strong>FB full-screen problem.</strong> The steps are:</p><p>Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on “Settings” and then head-to-head to the “Extensions” from “Main Tools.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-5.jpg"                      alt="open chrome extensions"                ></p><p>Step 2: Disable the extensions by toggling them off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-6.jpg"                      alt="disable your chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3: Disabling Hardware Acceleration</strong></p><p>The enabled Hardware Acceleration enhances the operation of different programs used on the browser.

Click on “Settings” and then head-to-head to the “Extensions” from “Main Tools.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-5.jpg"                      alt="open chrome extensions"                ></p><p>Step 2: Disable the extensions by toggling them off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-6.jpg"                      alt="disable your chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3: Disabling Hardware Acceleration</strong></p><p>The enabled Hardware Acceleration enhances the operation of different programs used on the browser.
