Feature a Video on Facebook Page</h3><p>Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.</p><p>It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.</p><p>You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feature-video-facebook.JPG"                      alt="feature video facebook"                ></p><h3 id="6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail-3"><a href="#6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="facebook thumbnail"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016148/19272" target="_top" id="2016148">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016148" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016148/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos-3"><a href="#7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

And the upside is huge.</p><p> A hashtag delivers expanded reach on the platform. A previous post would only be seen by followers or those who specifically search for your business name on the platform. Hashtags ensure that anyone clicking on a hashtag and browsing through the feed may come across your content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags"><a href="#Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags"></a>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</h2><p> Hashtags are a concept that first started on Twitter, where individuals were able to add a # before writing a word or phrase. The hashtag is a searchable device on these social media platforms, as a person is able to click on the hashtag and see other posts that include it as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >Every hashtag that is created on Facebook has its own URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Use Popular Hashtags</h3><p> The first rule to succeeding with hashtags is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamtechie.com/2013/05/an-update-on-facebook-and-hashtags/" >use ones that are already very popular <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross Social Performance"></a>2. Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests. While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.

To keep the originality of the content, terms such as copyright are kept in the account. Digital content creators creating unique and original content need to protect their work from being copied across the place. Many people utilize other creators’ work for gaining monetary gains.</p><p>To counter all such threats of copyright infringement, social media platforms such as Facebook provides users with a clear copyright action policy. Not only does this explain how users can counter issues of copyright with their content, but it also focuses on how they can avoid it across their content. This article focuses on the <strong>Facebook video copyright</strong> details and discusses how users can counter where their videos are removed across the platform.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Copyright – Explaining All Important Dynamics to this Legal Right</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">I Posted a Video on Facebook, Which was Removed Immediately!

Any work that has been designed, developed, or created by a user has copyright over it once it has been created and deployed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-copyright-1.jpg"                      alt="what is facebook copyright policy"                ></p><p>Talking about what copyright covers in its ambits, a variety of work is catered across this terminology. Any visual or audiovisual work, audio content, and literary work created by users have designated copyrights of the user responsible for its creation. The basic eligibility criteria for such content is to be original to fit the cross-fits of copyright.</p><p>This requires the content to have a minimum percentage of creativity that would cater to its plausibility to have copyright over it. However, names, slogans, and titles do not come with the possibility of having copyrights over them.</p><h3 id="How-to-Know-The-Content-Can-Have-Copyrights"><a href="#How-to-Know-The-Content-Can-Have-Copyrights" class="headerlink" title="How to Know The Content Can Have Copyrights?"></a>How to Know The Content Can Have Copyrights?</h3><p>Until now, many would question how they can have the idea of the content to own <strong>Facebook video copyright</strong>? To answer this question, it is better to go through a few situations that would explain how a user can assess their content to have copyright.

Well, with the new Facebook avatar, you can now create your cartoonish characters, set it as your profile picture, and share it with others.</p><p>Recently, the social media giant rolled out its Avatar feature for users in the US.

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite"><a href="#Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite-3"><a href="#Facebook-Avatar-Vs-Bitmoji-Vs-Memoji-Which-One-is-Your-Favorite-3" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?"></a>Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?</h2><p>Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’</p><p>The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.</p><p>As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.</p><p>Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.</p><p>Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.</p><p>Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!</p><p>People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1574708892866390&ref=sharing" >Lad Saves Squirrel Having A Seizure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art"><a href="#Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 5: This Master Is Genius!

This video’s like and react count has reached an amazing 555k even though it was published on 2nd December 2021.</p><p>The video features a female model and a master sculptor who uses body silicone to cover up the model’s upper body and then covers the silicone with plaster bandages to harden and give shape and strength to the mold.</p><p>Later, he uses a gypsum mix to fill the mold, and then as it dries, he extracts the finished sculpture from the mold.</p><p>In the second part, he covers the face and head of the model, first with Vaseline and then the same body silicone. Vaseline is introduced, so the silicone does not stick to the face and is easier to take off as the mold dries. After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!</p><p>Artistic videos have been seen to grasp a growing number of viewers and have started to top the charts!

This video was, once again, uploaded by the Facebook page ‘LADbible’ on 4th December 2021. It has collected a total view count of more than 72 million. The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.</p><p>The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.</p><p>First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.</p><p>Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.</p><p>The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.</p><p>The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.</p><p>Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=492573185317161&ref=sharing" >Chef Loves Pranking His Customers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea"><a href="#Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea"></a>Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Incredible Moments At Sea"                ></p><p>The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.</p><p>The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’</p><p>Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!</p><p>Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.</p><p>The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.</p><p>Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.</p><p>Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.</p><p>Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.</p><p>In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.</p><p>The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.</p><p>All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=796028924464858&ref=sharing" >Incredible Moments At Sea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora"></a>How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>There are many ways to enhance your content if you are a Facebook Video uploader.

One of the most popular and powerful video editing tools is WonderShare Filmora.

That is the ideal duration for a viral video so keep that in mind.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983446">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983446">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983446.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983446%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983446/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Every year amazing content appears on the internet with improved quality and unique life perspectives.

It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’</p><p>The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.</p><p>As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.</p><p>Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.</p><p>Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.</p><p>Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!</p><p>People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1574708892866390&ref=sharing" >Lad Saves Squirrel Having A Seizure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art-1"><a href="#Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art-1" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 5: This Master Is Genius!

Vaseline is introduced, so the silicone does not stick to the face and is easier to take off as the mold dries. After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!</p><p>Artistic videos have been seen to grasp a growing number of viewers and have started to top the charts!

The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.</p><p>The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.</p><p>First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.</p><p>Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.</p><p>The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.</p><p>The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.</p><p>Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=492573185317161&ref=sharing" >Chef Loves Pranking His Customers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-1"><a href="#Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-1" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea"></a>Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Incredible Moments At Sea"                ></p><p>The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.</p><p>The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’</p><p>Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!</p><p>Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.</p><p>The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.</p><p>Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.</p><p>Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.</p><p>Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.</p><p>In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.</p><p>The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.</p><p>All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=796028924464858&ref=sharing" >Incredible Moments At Sea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora"></a>How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>There are many ways to enhance your content if you are a Facebook Video uploader.

The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.</p><p>The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.</p><p>First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.</p><p>Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.</p><p>The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.</p><p>The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.</p><p>Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=492573185317161&ref=sharing" >Chef Loves Pranking His Customers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-2"><a href="#Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-2" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea"></a>Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Incredible Moments At Sea"                ></p><p>The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.</p><p>The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’</p><p>Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!</p><p>Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.</p><p>The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.</p><p>Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.</p><p>Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.</p><p>Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.</p><p>In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.</p><p>The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.</p><p>All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=796028924464858&ref=sharing" >Incredible Moments At Sea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora"></a>How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>There are many ways to enhance your content if you are a Facebook Video uploader.

The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.</p><p>The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.</p><p>Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=492573185317161&ref=sharing" >Chef Loves Pranking His Customers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-3"><a href="#Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea"></a>Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Incredible Moments At Sea"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043594/7443" target="_top" id="2043594">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043594" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043594/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.</p><p>The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’</p><p>Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!</p><p>Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.</p><p>The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.</p><p>Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.</p><p>Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.</p><p>Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.</p><p>In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.</p><p>The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.</p><p>All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=796028924464858&ref=sharing" >Incredible Moments At Sea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora"></a>How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>There are many ways to enhance your content if you are a Facebook Video uploader.
