Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137212/26400" target="_top" id="2137212">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137212" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137212/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming. These are the steps you need to take to clear the browser cache.</p><p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong></p><ol><li>Open chrome. Look for three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the browser. Click on that.</li><li>Select ‘More tools’</li><li>Tap on ‘Clear browsing data’ or press Ctrl+Shift+Del keys simultaneously.</li><li>Choose the time range you want the browser history cleared. Select ‘All time’ for a full wipe.</li><li>Click on ‘Cached images and files’ along with other options.</li><li>Click ‘Clear data.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-7.png"                      alt="clear browsing data on google chrome"                ></p><h3 id="Method-5-Disable-Adblock"><a href="#Method-5-Disable-Adblock" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Disable Adblock"></a>Method 5: Disable Adblock</h3><p>One way to prevent your live streams from getting disrupted is to disable your Adblock. There are options within the browser extension that you can use. There is also a carte-blanche option. This works for all ad-blockers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on ‘Manage Add-ons’</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select ‘Toolbars and Extensions’</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right-click your ad-block and tap on the ‘Disable’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-8.png"                      alt="disable extension to stop live stream interruptions"                ></p><p>Those were the steps you need to take to fix any Facebook live video problems.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-2"><a href="#In-this-article-2" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-2"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484910/16446" target="_top" id="1484910">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484910" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484910/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections-3"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming. These are the steps you need to take to clear the browser cache.</p><p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong></p><ol><li>Open chrome. Look for three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the browser. Click on that.</li><li>Select ‘More tools’</li><li>Tap on ‘Clear browsing data’ or press Ctrl+Shift+Del keys simultaneously.</li><li>Choose the time range you want the browser history cleared. Select ‘All time’ for a full wipe.</li><li>Click on ‘Cached images and files’ along with other options.</li><li>Click ‘Clear data.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-7.png"                      alt="clear browsing data on google chrome"                ></p><h3 id="Method-5-Disable-Adblock-3"><a href="#Method-5-Disable-Adblock-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Disable Adblock"></a>Method 5: Disable Adblock</h3><p>One way to prevent your live streams from getting disrupted is to disable your Adblock. There are options within the browser extension that you can use. There is also a carte-blanche option. This works for all ad-blockers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on ‘Manage Add-ons’</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select ‘Toolbars and Extensions’</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right-click your ad-block and tap on the ‘Disable’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-8.png"                      alt="disable extension to stop live stream interruptions"                ></p><p>Those were the steps you need to take to fix any Facebook live video problems.

Whether you talk about entertainment, business, or even marketing, Facebook is leading the internet world. We usually come across videos on Facebook that we like. Sometimes we want to download those videos and share them with our friends and family. A slight problem might be observed while doing this.</p><p>Facebook does not let you download videos.

Hence, this option is only applicable when a user has saved their stories for public view.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Save-Posts-from-Your-Stories-Archive-to-Your-Device-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Save-Posts-from-Your-Stories-Archive-to-Your-Device-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Save Posts from Your Stories Archive to Your Device?"></a>Part 4: How to Save Posts from Your Stories Archive to Your Device?</h2><p>We tend not to save stories to our devices when clicking them directly from the Facebook app. However, you can save a post to your device from the stories archive using simple steps.

While using Facebook, if you find some content shareable, you can easily <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram.</strong> Most users are not aware of sharing the video within seconds, which leaves them frustrated with the process. However, to cover this frustration, this part provides a guide on how to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram iPhone</strong> with ease.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch Facebook and Share</strong></p><p>You are advised to open Facebook and scroll down to find the video that you wish to share. Tap on the “Share” button and access a menu further. You will find a list of different options across that menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-instagram-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on share button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Look for Instagram in Options</strong></p><p>Select “More Options” from the available menu and proceed to select “Instagram” from the list that appears on the screen, showing different platforms where the video can be shared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-instagram-2.jpg"                      alt="click on more option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Share Video Link with Desired Users</strong></p><p>This redirects you to a window showing your Instagram friends that you can send the video. Find your friend within the list or search through to locate their Instagram account. Tap on the account or accounts that you wish to send this video too, and proceed by tapping on “Send.” The user is sent a link to the video that they can easily access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-instagram-3.jpg"                      alt="select person and tap send"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Share-Facebook-Videos-to-Instagram-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Share-Facebook-Videos-to-Instagram-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Share Facebook Videos to Instagram on Android"></a>Part 2: Share Facebook Videos to Instagram on Android</h2><p>There is a similar case that is being considered for Android users when it comes to sharing Facebook videos across Instagram. If you are looking for a convenient option to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram Android,</strong> the platform allows you to share the content with someone across your Instagram directly. Look into the steps explaining the complete process in detail.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Reach Out the Share Button on Android</strong></p><p>Launch Facebook on your Android device and scroll down your News Feed to find the video that is to be shared across Instagram. On finding a video, tap on the “Share” button.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Look for Instagram to Share</strong></p><p>This opens a list of different options that can be covered for sharing across Facebook. Select “More Options” from the available menu and proceed to locate “Instagram” across the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-instagram-5.jpg"                      alt="choose instagram"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Send Link to Username</strong></p><p>On selecting Instagram, the page is redirected to a window showing the list of accounts that the user can send the video to. Search through the list and tap on the “Send” button to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram</strong> with ease. The link to the Facebook video is shared with the user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-instagram-6.jpg"                      alt="tap on send button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Share-Facebook-Videos-to-Instagram-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-3-Share-Facebook-Videos-to-Instagram-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Share Facebook Videos to Instagram on Desktop"></a>Part 3: Share Facebook Videos to Instagram on Desktop</h2><p>Sharing content from Facebook to Instagram through iPhone and Android is quite limited. However, while covering the best possible case of sharing videos across Instagram through smartphones in the parts above, this is the most that a user can do without turning themselves into difficulty. To find variety in sharing content, users can turn onto the desktop version for different results.</p><p>Sharing content from Facebook to Instagram never came as an option across the platform. It was not available until recently; Facebook introduced cross-posting across its desktop tool. To clarify, this feature is not yet available across the mobile applications of Facebook. Cross-posting, however, is believed to be taken to greater bounds which would then be made available across the mobile versions.</p><p>Before leading to the steps that would explain the process of cross-posting, it is important to realize the reasons that are associated with cross-posting. This is quite similar to sharing content rather than reposting content across the accounts. One of the major reasons for opting for this feature is to save time and effort for users. With the tasks of posting frequently and maintaining the social media presence across different platforms, cross-posting turns out to be quite effective.</p><p>When users wish to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram</strong> across their desktop, they can surely look towards the steps of cross-posting with Facebook. However, while discussing the advantages of having cross-posting as a feature across Facebook, another benefit revolves around leaving down the hassle of creating posts for both platforms separately.</p><h3 id="Limitations-with-Cross-Posting"><a href="#Limitations-with-Cross-Posting" class="headerlink" title="Limitations with Cross-Posting"></a>Limitations with Cross-Posting</h3><p>Cross-posting has made sharing content quite easy for people across both ends. Not only can users ensure the sharing of their content across Facebook, but they can also feel relieved on having their content shared across Instagram. This feature is yet being tested by Facebook and is quite limited as a whole. These restrictions and limitations are believed to be for a while, which would be then left alone after consistent development.</p><p>This feature across Facebook is not available across personal accounts for now. Only users with business pages can consider utilizing this feature. Along with that, users need to be aware of the fact that they can only consider using the “Post Now” option instead of the “Post Later” option, as cross-posting cannot work under the latter option. There is a lot that this feature has to yet come up with while making the usability more effective.</p><p>While keeping these limitations within consideration, cross-posting can be considered to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram.</strong> For this, the user is advised to look into the steps that are featured below. The steps show a clear understanding of how the user needs to utilize cross-posting to share their required content across Instagram without any difficulty.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Locate the Settings within Facebook Page</strong></p><p>Lead to the Facebook Page that you manage through your account and reach out to its ‘Settings’ across the left-hand menu of the page.

However, while covering the best possible case of sharing videos across Instagram through smartphones in the parts above, this is the most that a user can do without turning themselves into difficulty. To find variety in sharing content, users can turn onto the desktop version for different results.</p><p>Sharing content from Facebook to Instagram never came as an option across the platform. It was not available until recently; Facebook introduced cross-posting across its desktop tool. To clarify, this feature is not yet available across the mobile applications of Facebook. Cross-posting, however, is believed to be taken to greater bounds which would then be made available across the mobile versions.</p><p>Before leading to the steps that would explain the process of cross-posting, it is important to realize the reasons that are associated with cross-posting. This is quite similar to sharing content rather than reposting content across the accounts. One of the major reasons for opting for this feature is to save time and effort for users. With the tasks of posting frequently and maintaining the social media presence across different platforms, cross-posting turns out to be quite effective.</p><p>When users wish to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram</strong> across their desktop, they can surely look towards the steps of cross-posting with Facebook. However, while discussing the advantages of having cross-posting as a feature across Facebook, another benefit revolves around leaving down the hassle of creating posts for both platforms separately.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006955/19272" target="_top" id="2006955">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006955" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006955/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Limitations-with-Cross-Posting-1"><a href="#Limitations-with-Cross-Posting-1" class="headerlink" title="Limitations with Cross-Posting"></a>Limitations with Cross-Posting</h3><p>Cross-posting has made sharing content quite easy for people across both ends. Not only can users ensure the sharing of their content across Facebook, but they can also feel relieved on having their content shared across Instagram. This feature is yet being tested by Facebook and is quite limited as a whole. These restrictions and limitations are believed to be for a while, which would be then left alone after consistent development.</p><p>This feature across Facebook is not available across personal accounts for now. Only users with business pages can consider utilizing this feature. Along with that, users need to be aware of the fact that they can only consider using the “Post Now” option instead of the “Post Later” option, as cross-posting cannot work under the latter option. There is a lot that this feature has to yet come up with while making the usability more effective.</p><p>While keeping these limitations within consideration, cross-posting can be considered to <strong>share Facebook video to Instagram.</strong> For this, the user is advised to look into the steps that are featured below. The steps show a clear understanding of how the user needs to utilize cross-posting to share their required content across Instagram without any difficulty.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Locate the Settings within Facebook Page</strong></p><p>Lead to the Facebook Page that you manage through your account and reach out to its ‘Settings’ across the left-hand menu of the page.

Approximately around 2.7 billion users use Facebook actively. Using Facebook video ads as a source for your brand promotion is a golden chance to gain the attention of a huge potential audience.</p><p>Facebook is a very strong platform, so hence, nothing could be better than using it for your brand awareness.

It is very crucial to convey complete information to the customer.

A static image can never hold the viewers’ attention for long enough, whereas a video ad can sustain your customer interest as long as the video is conveying something. Your brand should make a Facebook video ad.</p><h3 id="Retarget-your-Audience"><a href="#Retarget-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Retarget your Audience"></a>Retarget your Audience</h3><p>Another important reason why Facebook video ads are important in marketing is that it retargets the audience. Promoting your brand once is never enough. You should keep reminding the audience about your product and its benefits. For that, video ads are the best option to retarget your audience again and again.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Facebook-Video-Ads-Better"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Facebook-Video-Ads-Better" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

For such conditions, we are here to help you. Given below are the tips and tricks that will contribute to making better Facebook video ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-facebook-video-ads-in-a-creative-way-3.jpg"                      alt="tips for making facebook video ads perfect"                ></p><h3 id="1-Video-Formatting"><a href="#1-Video-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Formatting"></a>1. Video Formatting</h3><p>The most important tip when it comes to Facebook ads videos is the formatting. We always forget the crucial fact that this is a multi-device era. Every person uses at least 2 devices. So, while you make Facebook video ads, make sure that the video is in both portraits and in the landscape too. You should give your viewer a full-screen view on whatsoever device they prefer.</p><h3 id="2-Keep-Things-Interesting"><a href="#2-Keep-Things-Interesting" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep Things Interesting"></a>2. Keep Things Interesting</h3><p>Attracting viewers is easy as compared to sustaining their interest in your content and your brand. For that, the best suggestion is to keep things interesting for them. You can create Facebook video ads by implementing different styles. You can sometimes add BTS (Behind the Scenes) to your video. Making some kind of tutorial or recording an informative video can also do the job in a better way.</p><h3 id="3-Add-Caption"><a href="#3-Add-Caption" class="headerlink" title="3. Add Caption"></a>3. Add Caption</h3><p>It has been observed and noticed that 85% of the audience watch videos on Facebook with sound off. For such scenarios, you must add captions to your content. This way, even if the sound is off, your message will be conveyed to the viewer. Even if the sound is off, you can still promote your brand.</p><h3 id="4-Video-Length"><a href="#4-Video-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Length"></a>4. Video Length</h3><p>While you are planning to create Facebook video ads, you should not ignore the element of video length. Not every person sits and listens to complete video ads. It’s best to make small and concise video ads, yet they should be informative. You must convey your message and promote your brand early in the video so that no one misses or ignores it.</p><h3 id="5-Content-Quality"><a href="#5-Content-Quality" class="headerlink" title="5. Content Quality"></a>5. Content Quality</h3><p>For your Facebook ads video, you should maintain the quality of the content. Although it is mentioned to take care of the video length yet, the video must cover the essentials for the brand and the product. An ad video that lacks sharing basic information about the brand is nearly useless. A good Facebook video ad must have a conversion, consideration, and lastly, awareness.</p><h2 id="Part-3-5-Attractive-Video-Effects-Pack-for-Facebook-Video-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-5-Attractive-Video-Effects-Pack-for-Facebook-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. 5 Attractive Video Effects Pack for Facebook Video Ads"></a>Part 3. 5 Attractive Video Effects Pack for Facebook Video Ads</h2><p>Once you have created your Facebook video ad, now it’s time to edit it.

The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response. In case, your verification request is rejected, it is due to the following reasons.</p><pre><code>  * **Press releases or marketing is less** \- When your press is less, it is highly possible that your verification request is rejected as your business or page is not identified accurately. You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/).

The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response.

You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.  * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.</code></pre><h2 id="Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification-3"><a href="#Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification"></a>Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification</h2><h3 id="1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information-3"><a href="#1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method"><a href="#First-Method" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu.

You need to keep in mind that the maximum time limit for broadcasting on Facebook is 30 minutes.</p><p> 2. If you get trolled by other users while broadcasting or you don’t like the comments from a viewer then you can choose to block them from the broadcast. Just click on their profile pic which appears beside their comment and hit <strong>‘Block’</strong>.</p><p> 3. Before you go live on Facebook make sure that you have fast connection. Wi-fi works best for live broadcast on Facebook. If you don’t have wifi access then try using a 4G connection. Ideally you should check the speed of your net before you start broadcasting. For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.</p><p> 4. Once the broadcast is done the video is going to appear on your Facebook profile page and can be seen by your selected audience. However you can choose to remove the video at any time if your want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925489/19272" target="_top" id="1925489">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925489" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925489/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Facebook has recently launched a live feature which would allow the users to broadcast the important moments of their live to a large audience.

How to Watch Facebook Live Stream on Desktop?"></a>Part 1. How to Watch Facebook Live Stream on Desktop?</h2><p>Watching a Facebook live event can be easy on your desktop. Here’s how you can do it.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign Into Facebook On Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>You can watch any Facebook live video on your PC or MacBook. First, you need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/" >www.facebook.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log in. After entering your credentials, you can set about finding a way to watch live streams.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-1.png"                      alt="login to facebook"                ></p><p>You can also watch live streams on your web browser without logging in. For this, you will need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/live" >www.facebook.com/watch/live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&#x2F;. This will let you search for the particular live stream you’re looking for. Please note that you can watch the video to your heart’s content. You will not interact with the video through emoji reactions or comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-2.png"                      alt="access facebook live with video url"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select The Watch (TV) Icon</strong></p><p>You’ll notice a row of icons at the top of the Facebook page. From those icons, select an icon that looks like a small tv. This icon will take you to the section with live streams and edited videos for upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-3.png"                      alt="use watch to catch facebook live streams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on the Live tab.</strong></p><p>An alternative to that step is to click on the Live tab. You can find the live tab on the left-hand side panel. This opens a new page where you can watch live videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-4.png"                      alt="click on the live tab on facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Look for the Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-5.png"                      alt="use menu to watch facebook live"                ></p><p>You can also tap on the ‘Menu,’ indicated by nine dots. This will open a drop-down menu where you can scroll down. Select ‘watch’ to take you to the live stream page you want to see.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png"                      alt="use menu to look for live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams</strong></p><p>Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red ‘Live’ tab on the top left corner.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Communicate on Chat</strong></p><p>You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You’ll be back on the ‘Watch’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-8.png"                      alt="exit live stream on facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?"></a>Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?</h2><p>The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png"                      alt="use watch icon to find videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Find Live Tab</strong></p><p>Below the ‘Watch’ tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone</h2><p>You can also watch Facebook live on your iPhone. The steps are broadly similar to Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app</strong></p><p>You can log into the Facebook app. iPhones also support your ability to view live streams on browsers. You can watch the live on your mobile browser. However, you won’t be able to interact with the video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Find the Menu</strong></p><p>Look for the three horizontal lines icon. This is the ‘Menu’ icon on the bottom right. Tap on this icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="Find menu on iphone facebook app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap on ‘Live videos’</strong></p><p>Select the ‘Live videos’ icons.

You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream.

You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator.

Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load.

From getting a teaser of the video before watching it in its entirety to making your scrolling efficient, <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> has proved to be quite effective.</p><p>While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements.

However, there are some drawbacks to utilizing this feature. Some users do not prefer turning this feature across their devices for specific reasons. To understand why <strong>autoplay on Facebook</strong> can bother you, you need to look across the following reasons in detail.</p><h3 id="Putting-in-Awkward-Situations"><a href="#Putting-in-Awkward-Situations" class="headerlink" title="Putting in Awkward Situations"></a>Putting in Awkward Situations</h3><p><strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> makes video run automatically while scrolling down the platform. There are several instances where you may feel uneasy about listening to sounds after every other video passes by. For example, if you are sitting in a library and going through Facebook for some reason, the sound of the video can surely make things very awkward for you.</p><p>It is highly advisable that users can turn off the autoplay feature under such circumstances, as it would allow them to stay out of situations that would make them confused while sitting anywhere.</p><h3 id="Use-of-Data"><a href="#Use-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="Use of Data"></a>Use of Data</h3><p>There are cases where the autoplay feature across Facebook is turned on in conditions that consume unnecessary mobile phone data. If you have restricted access to mobile data with a limit, having the feature turned on across mobile data would even consume MBs, putting you in complicated situations.</p><p>In other cases, this can potentially cost your extra mobile services, which can turn out to be monetarily expensive.</p><h3 id="Consumption-of-Battery"><a href="#Consumption-of-Battery" class="headerlink" title="Consumption of Battery"></a>Consumption of Battery</h3><p>The mobile data turned on across your device can consume your battery faster. The unnecessary play of the video consumes the battery and can leave you in situations where you may not have any access to a battery source. To avoid discrepancies under such circumstances, it is advised to turn off the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature as it would save battery for you, keeping your device turned on for a longer time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has addressed the autoplay feature of Facebook in detail.

While allowing users to add videos to Facebook with its proficient tools under a few restrictions, Facebook also believes in making things simpler for its viewers. For this, the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature plays a pivotal role in providing ease to the viewers in going through videos.</p><p>The autoplay feature on Facebook explains as the tool that automatically plays the video for the users across the page it appears. Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook.

[4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode-1"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe-1"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them-1"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-1"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account.

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe-2"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end.

This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-comparative-analysis-of-fb-video-formats/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Comparative Analysis of FB Video Formats</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-facebook-video-downloader-application-for-mobilewinmac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Facebook Video Downloader Application for Mobile/Win/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-comprehensive-guide-to-climbing-the-facebook-rankings-ladder/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Comprehensive Guide to Climbing the Facebook Rankings Ladder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cutting-edge-tech-to-record-your-remote-gatherings/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Tech to Record Your Remote Gatherings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-prime-websites-boosting-youtube-video-popularity/"><u>[New] In 2024, Prime Websites Boosting YouTube Video Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-auto-play-youtube-content-in-fb/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Auto-Play YouTube Content in FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/rofit-potentials-in-producing-product-centric-youtube-clips/"><u>[New] Profit Potentials in Producing Product-Centric YouTube Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-beat-coffee-stain-effects-with-ioss-complimentary-red-eye-fix-app/"><u>[Updated] Beat Coffee Stain Effects with iOS's Complimentary Red-Eye Fix App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-bring-forth-forgotten-vids-unlock-the-power-of-these-12-secrets-fb-2023/"><u>[Updated] Bring Forth Forgotten Vids Unlock the Power of These 12 Secrets, FB, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-perfecting-movie-recording-your-multiplatform-strategy-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Perfecting Movie Recording Your Multiplatform Strategy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-keeping-track-of-facetime-with-facebooks-live-feature/"><u>2024 Approved Keeping Track of FaceTime with Facebook's Live Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-targeted-thought-leadership-with-profound-fb-video-strategies/"><u>2024 Approved Targeted Thought Leadership with Profound FB Video Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/enhance-performance-overcome-lagging-and-increase-fps-for-a-smooth-rdr2-gameplay/"><u>Enhance Performance: Overcome Lagging and Increase FPS for a Smooth RDR2 Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-find-ispoofer-pro-activation-key-on-nokia-c02-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Find iSpoofer Pro Activation Key On Nokia C02?
