Here’s how you can do it.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign Into Facebook On Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>You can watch any Facebook live video on your PC or MacBook. First, you need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/" >www.facebook.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and log in. After entering your credentials, you can set about finding a way to watch live streams.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-1.png"                      alt="login to facebook"                ></p><p>You can also watch live streams on your web browser without logging in. For this, you will need to go to <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/live" >www.facebook.com/watch/live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>&#x2F;. This will let you search for the particular live stream you’re looking for. Please note that you can watch the video to your heart’s content. You will not interact with the video through emoji reactions or comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-2.png"                      alt="access facebook live with video url"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select The Watch (TV) Icon</strong></p><p>You’ll notice a row of icons at the top of the Facebook page. From those icons, select an icon that looks like a small tv. This icon will take you to the section with live streams and edited videos for upload.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-3.png"                      alt="use watch to catch facebook live streams"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on the Live tab.</strong></p><p>An alternative to that step is to click on the Live tab. You can find the live tab on the left-hand side panel. This opens a new page where you can watch live videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-4.png"                      alt="click on the live tab on facebook"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Look for the Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-5.png"                      alt="use menu to watch facebook live"                ></p><p>You can also tap on the ‘Menu,’ indicated by nine dots. This will open a drop-down menu where you can scroll down. Select ‘watch’ to take you to the live stream page you want to see.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png"                      alt="use menu to look for live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams</strong></p><p>Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red ‘Live’ tab on the top left corner.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Communicate on Chat</strong></p><p>You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You’ll be back on the ‘Watch’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-8.png"                      alt="exit live stream on facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?"></a>Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?</h2><p>The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png"                      alt="use watch icon to find videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Find Live Tab</strong></p><p>Below the ‘Watch’ tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone</h2><p>You can also watch Facebook live on your iPhone. The steps are broadly similar to Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app</strong></p><p>You can log into the Facebook app. iPhones also support your ability to view live streams on browsers. You can watch the live on your mobile browser. However, you won’t be able to interact with the video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Find the Menu</strong></p><p>Look for the three horizontal lines icon. This is the ‘Menu’ icon on the bottom right. Tap on this icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="Find menu on iphone facebook app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap on ‘Live videos’</strong></p><p>Select the ‘Live videos’ icons. This will take you to the list of videos currently streamed live. You can find your creator’s video there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="use live to search for videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Specific Videos</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-14.png"                      alt="use menu to search for videos"                ></p><p>You can look for a specific video or even a specific topic. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. You can search according to the name or phrase. Use filters to manage your results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-15.png"                      alt="use menu to search for videos"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-TV"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily.

These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream.

It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen.

With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily.

If you don’t have any time to lose, this option is perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png"                      alt="use magnifying glass to search for videos"                ></p><p>Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter&#x2F;return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red ‘Live’ tab on the top left corner.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Communicate on Chat</strong></p><p>You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you’ll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.</p><p><strong>Step 7: Close the Live Video</strong></p><p>You can check out of a live stream by selecting the ‘x’ button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You’ll be back on the ‘Watch’ page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-8.png"                      alt="exit live stream on facebook"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Watch-Facebook-Live-on-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?"></a>Part 2. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?</h2><p>The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It’s different enough for these steps. Let’s use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open the Facebook app.</strong></p><p>You can look for the Facebook icon. It’s a blue circle with the small letter ‘f’ in white. Again, if you’re viewing live streams on mobile, you can use <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/" >www.facebook.com/watch/live/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png"                      alt="find the facebook app on android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885928/19272" target="_top" id="1885928">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885928" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885928/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2: Select ‘Watch’</strong></p><p>The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone’s screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png"                      alt="use watch icon to find videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Find Live Tab</strong></p><p>Below the ‘Watch’ tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like ‘For You,’ ‘Live,’ Music,’ and more. Select ‘Live’ from this list. The ‘Watch’ tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png"                      alt="use live tab to find live videos"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Search for Live Videos</strong></p><p>If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Find-Facebook-Live-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You can watch the live on your mobile browser. However, you won’t be able to interact with the video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Find the Menu</strong></p><p>Look for the three horizontal lines icon. This is the ‘Menu’ icon on the bottom right. Tap on this icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-12.png"                      alt="Find menu on iphone facebook app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap on ‘Live videos’</strong></p><p>Select the ‘Live videos’ icons.

Although the platform can be directly utilized for this purpose, several other software is supported throughout the live stream.</p><p>Users can consider using OBS Studio, Wirecast, or XSplit to cater to their streaming requirements. Facebook allows its users to consider any of the software mentioned above for their purpose. For going into a live stream, the user can consider going from a profile, Facebook page, group, or event. With diversity in selecting the source for going live, users can consider going live by sharing their screen, game, or external camera as the video resource.</p><p>Before going to <strong>stream 1080p Facebook,</strong> you might need to enable stream settings for your account.

Although <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> is different kind of scam, such types are more confusing and irritating to counter. Urgent personal messages have been an effective form of viruses fraudsters have used to gain personal information from Facebook messages.</p><p>This form of the virus has turned out to be a conventional virus type; however, only a single download was what could breach your personal information. Your account would be breached over a single click, and you’ll be countering a problem that might never get easy on you.</p><h3 id="Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses"><a href="#Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Video Scam Viruses"></a>Facebook Video Scam Viruses</h3><p><strong>Facebook video scam</strong> has been at the forefront of viruses, where it has breached a lot of users’ privacy with its simple yet effective technique of gaining personal information. Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.</p><p>Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.</p><h3 id="Fake-Facebook-Applications"><a href="#Fake-Facebook-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Fake Facebook Applications"></a>Fake Facebook Applications</h3><p>People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications. The renowned icon has been copied and utilized in different forms, which, if downloaded, traps the user into the virus. If installed and opened, this virus leads you into one of the biggest and most threatening conditions.</p><p>The user who gives authorized permissions to such applications gets their phones breached to the root. A single click to installation puts your complete profile under an inadvertent threat.</p><h3 id="Spam-Posts"><a href="#Spam-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Spam Posts"></a>Spam Posts</h3><p>Unusual posts across Facebook’s timeline are another form of gaining access to your account credentials. Posts that seem too good to be true or have unrealistic patterns usually put people’s profiles at risk if accessed potentially. If clicked across these posts, these online links and spam links are the killers to your profile.</p><p>Users are usually advised to report these posts on observing such suspicious activities. Although, a few put their profile at risk for winning a chance in the “online lottery.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?"></a>Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?</h2><p>The main idea of the “Is That You” Facebook video virus is to breach the users’ privacy and take in potential information that would effectively harm the image or the profile security. There is a need to look into the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and dissect all the possibilities that associate the situation and the possibilities it brings for the hackers behind it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-2.jpg"                      alt="is that you fb scam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message"><a href="#What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message" class="headerlink" title="What Happens After You Click the Link or Message"></a>What Happens After You Click the Link or Message</h3><p>This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams. Users are tricked into giving their confidential credit card details, leading to monetary threats and scams. It has been reported that users have potentially lost money due to this mistake of letting hackers go into the account.</p><p>The developers of these viruses have an objective of personal gains out of these kinds of viruses, which can be quite a botheration for the users. The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</h2><p>Considering you have been victim to such a <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> virus, or you wish to take preventive measures to save yourselves from such problems, there are a set of different techniques which should be followed to make your life free from such deceptive and destructive viruses.

It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted</strong>?</p><p>You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos. Let us share the reasons with you that why your <strong>video is partially muted</strong> on Facebook.</p><h3 id="1-Video-Gets-Reported"><a href="#1-Video-Gets-Reported" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Gets Reported"></a>1. Video Gets Reported</h3><p>One factor that aids in your <strong>Facebook video partially muted</strong> is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then <strong>your video is partially muted.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music"><a href="#2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music"></a>2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music</h3><p>Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.</p><p>If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either <strong>your video is partially muted on Facebook</strong>, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.</p><h3 id="3-Someone-Else’s-Music"><a href="#3-Someone-Else’s-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Someone Else’s Music"></a>3. Someone Else’s Music</h3><p>If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button.

A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments”.</p><p>This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option.

Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.</p><p>If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should ‘Dispute the Claimed Identity.’ You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted</strong>?</p><p>You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos.

Video Gets Reported"></a>1. Video Gets Reported</h3><p>One factor that aids in your <strong>Facebook video partially muted</strong> is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then <strong>your video is partially muted.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music-1"><a href="#2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music"></a>2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music</h3><p>Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.</p><p>If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either <strong>your video is partially muted on Facebook</strong>, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.</p><h3 id="3-Someone-Else’s-Music-1"><a href="#3-Someone-Else’s-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Someone Else’s Music"></a>3. Someone Else’s Music</h3><p>If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button.

A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments”.</p><p>This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-2.jpg"                      alt="restore facebook video audio"                ></p><h3 id="3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-1"><a href="#3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.</p><p>If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should ‘Dispute the Claimed Identity.’ You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
