Every young and old person uses various social media platforms. They could use these platforms to either connect with someone or maybe for entertainment purposes. In any case, we are always attracted by the videos we come across. Most of the time, we watch and enjoy the complete videos as they maintain our interest.</p><p>Rarely do we not watch the complete video. This only happens when the video fails to sustain your interest. This is commonly observed, and people complain that the <strong>Facebook video is partially muted.</strong> There are multiple reasons why <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> on Facebook. If you want to learn more about this, then stay with us.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip: How to Create Facebook Video with Music using Filmora to Avoid Copyright Issue?</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How to Mute Facebook Videos?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Video-Partially-Muted-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Is-Your-Video-Partially-Muted-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?</h2><p>Adding background music to your Facebook videos has its own significance. It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted</strong>?</p><p>You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos. Let us share the reasons with you that why your <strong>video is partially muted</strong> on Facebook.</p><h3 id="1-Video-Gets-Reported-3"><a href="#1-Video-Gets-Reported-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Gets Reported"></a>1. Video Gets Reported</h3><p>One factor that aids in your <strong>Facebook video partially muted</strong> is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then <strong>your video is partially muted.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music-3"><a href="#2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music"></a>2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music</h3><p>Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.</p><p>If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either <strong>your video is partially muted on Facebook</strong>, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.</p><h3 id="3-Someone-Else’s-Music-3"><a href="#3-Someone-Else’s-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Someone Else’s Music"></a>3. Someone Else’s Music</h3><p>If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?</h2><p>It is not at all shocking to see that with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted.</strong> This mostly happens because of the strict and non-flexible policies that Facebook has.

We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.</p><h3 id="1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-3"><a href="#1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button.

A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments”.</p><p>This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-2.jpg"                      alt="restore facebook video audio"                ></p><h3 id="3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-3"><a href="#3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.</p><p>If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should ‘Dispute the Claimed Identity.’ You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It’s capable of downloading videos up to 8K in resolution. You can also enjoy other video qualities like 4k, Ultra HD, 1080p, and more. It also works incredibly swiftly. The convenience and speed are two major reasons to download this Facebook video downloader in mp4. Another could be that it offers a clean and user-friendly interface.</p><p>SnapDownloader also allows users to download videos from Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc. There’s no need to limit yourself to a program that only lets you download videos when you can instead choose one that has an in-built video cutter and converter. You can download videos in various output formats, including mp4, avi, mp3, m4a, and more.</p><p>One benefit of using snap downloader is its built-in web browser that lets users download private videos, playlists, and content that generally need you to be logged in.</p><p>What better way to expedite the video download capabilities than with the “One-Click Mode.” This mode allows you to save your videos in your preferred format and output as a premium feature. All it needs is to input the link in the open text field.</p><p>It works on Windows and macOS X, so any personal computer can use this software. Downloads are available quickly from several websites online, including Facebook, YouTube, and more.</p><p>It allows you to download videos simultaneously from multiple websites. If you use the mp4 downloader on YouTube, you can even download entire playlists. It also comes with subtitles relevant to each video on download.</p><p>In the premium version, you can download 100 videos simultaneously from across multiple websites. Schedule the videos to be downloaded at a set time or queue videos on your video download list, so you don’t have to wait for the download to be complete and manually enter the link.</p><p>At the same time, you can trim the video to the length of your choice. For instance, if a video is segmented into different chapters, you can download an individual chapter. Alternatively, you can also trim the segment from the full video using the video cutter.</p><p>You can download geo-restricted content using the proxy setup support that lets you bypass geo-restrictions and download from websites or videos that are blocked in your region.</p><p>Download private Facebook videos using this video downloader. The advantage is that it enables you to download them as either a video or as audio according to your convenience.</p><p>Also, convert between MP4, MP3, and other audio and video formats.
