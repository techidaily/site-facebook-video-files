There are a few things to keep in mind when creating your image:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality images that are eye-catching and relevant to your product or service.</li><li>Make sure your text is easy to read, and avoid overcrowding your image with too much information.</li><li>Make sure your branding is consistent across all of your marketing materials.</li><li>Keep your target audience in mind when creating your image.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads"></a>Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you need to make a creative image before running a Facebook an Ad:</p><p>First, an eye-catching image will help to grab the reader’s attention and make them more likely to read your ad.</p><p>Second, including relevant images with your ad will help to illustrate your product or service and make it easier for your audience to understand what you’re selling.</p><p>And finally, having consistent branding across all of your marketing materials will help to create a professional image for your business.</p><h2 id="Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post"><a href="#Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post" class="headerlink" title="Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post"></a>Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post</h2><p>A Facebook post is simply a message that you post on your Facebook page. A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people’s Facebook pages. There are a few key differences between Facebook posts and ads:</p><ul><li>Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.</li><li>Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.</li><li>Facebook ads can include more information than posts, including clickable links and images.</li><li>Facebook ads will always be shown in the News Feed, while Facebook posts may not be seen by all of your followers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-feeds.jpg"                      alt="facebook feeds"                ></p><p>Now that you know the difference between a Facebook post and an ad, let’s take a look at how to create an effective ad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-effective-facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="create effective facebook ads"                ></p><h2 id="The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures"><a href="#The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures" class="headerlink" title="The Three Simple Copywriting Structures"></a>The Three Simple Copywriting Structures</h2><p><strong>#1. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

You can’t miss it - it’s <strong>bright green</strong>! You’ll be asked if you want to choose Guided Creation or Quick Creation. Either way is pretty easy to do, and you can experiment with both when you begin to see which works best for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-do-you-want-to-create-ad-campaigns.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Campaign Creation Guide Types"                ></p><p>In the following part, I’ll show you the steps after clicking Select Guided Creation for detailed explanation.</p><p>At first, you’ll need to select campaign objective, which is what you would like to result from your video ad. Choosing the right one here can be tricky, but <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1438417719786914" >here’s a guide to help you out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some possible marketing objectives to choose from include:</p><ul><li>Brand Awareness</li><li>Reach</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Engagement</li><li>Lead Generation</li><li>Conversions</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-campaign-marketing-objective.jpg"                      alt="choosing Facebook campaign marketing objective"                ></p><p>Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective. Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing A Format"></a>2. Choosing A Format</h4><p>Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:</p><ul><li>Carousel</li><li>Single Image or Video</li><li>Collection group for Fullscreen Mobile Experience</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-ad-choose-format.jpg"                      alt="create Facebook ads - choose format"                ></p><p>Note: if you’ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, you’ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.</p><h4 id="3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements"><a href="#3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements"></a>3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements</h4><p>Go to the <strong>Media</strong> section and now you can upload up to 10 images or videos and Facebook Dynamic Creative will generate multiple combinations; or, you can create slideshow or use the Video Template to create a new video with the Video Creation Kit.</p><p><strong>Add images to media</strong></p><p>Once you’ve begun to create your vid, you’ll find a button under the <strong>Media</strong> tab. Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg"                      alt="add Facebook ads image assets"                ></p><p>When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!</p><h3 id="Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?"></a>Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?</h3><p>As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:</p><ul><li>Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%</li><li>Facebook video get, on average, over <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/" >8 billion daily views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer</li><li>Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate</li></ul><p>No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!</p><h3 id="What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For-3"><a href="#What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For-3" class="headerlink" title="What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?"></a>What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?</h3><p>Whatever the purpose of your video, you’ll find the Facebook Video Creation Kit to be quite useful for you.

From being a platform where people could share their thoughts about their daily lives, Facebook eventually became everything people utilized to connect with the world. From messaging to sharing your stories, Facebook provided personal and professional features across the platform, making billions of users interact.</p><p>Videos are a common part of the platform where people consider this visual form of communication as a proficient way to express anything. From an idea to something that would make you laugh, Facebook caters to all kinds of videos across its social media platform. While going through Facebook, you prefer the video to play automatically to make it easy for you to go through the platform.</p><p>For this, <strong>the Facebook Autoplay</strong> feature provides you an impressive option to automatically play videos for yourself; without tapping any post to watch them. This article features the <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> feature and provides users with a detailed guide on <strong>autoplay on Facebook.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">What is Facebook Autoplay</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How Autoplay Feature Can Bother You in Using Facebook?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay"></a>Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay</h2><p>Facebook believes in efficiency and human-friendliness. The platform provides features of different contexts driven by efficiency and human-friendliness. While allowing users to add videos to Facebook with its proficient tools under a few restrictions, Facebook also believes in making things simpler for its viewers. For this, the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature plays a pivotal role in providing ease to the viewers in going through videos.</p><p>The autoplay feature on Facebook explains as the tool that automatically plays the video for the users across the page it appears. Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load. Autoplay provides many benefits to its users in multiple ways. From getting a teaser of the video before watching it in its entirety to making your scrolling efficient, <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> has proved to be quite effective.</p><p>While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements. When using the Autoplay feature on Facebook, users can set four different options according to their discretion. To make the tool effective, you can set it up across mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, you can turn towards the Wi-Fi-only option to save the internet.</p><p>The autoplay feature is not a mandatory option for users to manage. This feature can be easily turned off, giving people control over what and what not to play. On the other hand, using <strong>autoplay on Facebook</strong> also provides users with playing the video with sound. However, this is completely under the hands of the user, who select the best option according to their requirements.</p><p>Following this, <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> potentially works if the device’s battery is up and running. Facebook automatically turns off this option to optimize battery life on a low battery.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Guide-on-How-to-Autoplay-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Guide-on-How-to-Autoplay-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos"></a>Part 2: Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos</h2><p>This part provides users with a guide on autoplay a video on Facebook across multiple devices. Being an Android, iOS, or Chrome user, you can look into any of the following step-by-step guides to get a clear knowledge of using autoplay across Facebook.</p><h3 id="Autoplay-Facebook-Video-on-Android"><a href="#Autoplay-Facebook-Video-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Autoplay Facebook Video on Android"></a>Autoplay Facebook Video on Android</h3><p>To consume different options on Android across Facebook, you need to go through the following points. Facebook provides users with an effective platform, allowing them to take their measures. Android users who want to turn on Autoplay across their Facebook should cover the following steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Facebook on your Android device and tap on the three-bars option on the top-right of the home screen. This turns towards the “Menu” of Facebook. Lead into the “Settings &amp; Privacy” option on the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/autoplay-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="access settings and privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> A new set of options appear on the screen. Tap on “Settings” to lead to a new window. Next, tap on “Media” to access different video and audio options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/autoplay-facebook-videos-2.jpg"                      alt="open media settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will observe an Autoplay section within the window. Select any of the options showing “On mobile data and Wi-Fi” or “On Wi-Fi only” to turn on the Autoplay feature on Facebook. You can also turn on the “Videos start with sound” slider according to your discretion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/autoplay-facebook-videos-3.jpg"                      alt="setup autoplay on android"                ></p><h3 id="Autoplay-Facebook-Video-on-iPhone"><a href="#Autoplay-Facebook-Video-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Autoplay Facebook Video on iPhone"></a>Autoplay Facebook Video on iPhone</h3><p>iPhone users can have the similar opportunity of turning on the autoplay option across their Facebook application. To understand how to perfectly turn it on without going across the application in search of the right options, you need to look into the following steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Access Facebook on your iPhone and tap on the three-bar icon on the bottom right of the screen. This leads you into the “Menu” options of Facebook. Find out the “Settings &amp; Privacy” option by scrolling down the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/autoplay-facebook-videos-4.jpg"                      alt="open fb settings and privacy"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select “Settings” from the options that appear after clicking the screen. A new window opens up with different options for managing Facebook across iPhones. Select “Media” among the provided options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/autoplay-facebook-videos-5.jpg"                      alt="tap on media"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> This option can subjectively change different audio and video options.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook. One way is to use the web browser of your pc or Mac, the second is exploring Facebook stories on Facebook Messenger, and the third is by using the Facebook mobile app. We will discuss these three methods below.</p><h3 id="Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser"><a href="#Method-1-View-Facebook-Stories-through-the-Website-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser"></a>Method 1: View Facebook Stories through the Website Browser</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use any of the browsers on your computer and visit Facebook.Log in, and the home page will be displayed.

And on top of the messages, you will see the list of profiles that are currently active, and if any one of them has uploaded a story, their profile will have a blue circle.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on a profile, and the story will be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-messenger.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story via Messenger"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Open-Facebook-Mobile-App-to-View-Stories"><a href="#Method-3-Open-Facebook-Mobile-App-to-View-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Open Facebook Mobile App to View Stories"></a>Method 3: Open Facebook Mobile App to View Stories</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook mobile application.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story.

So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only.

Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-1"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators-1" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe-1"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them-1"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-1"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see.
