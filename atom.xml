You can quickly post stories through the Facebook mobile app and interact with your friends. Here is how you can view old stories on a mobile app:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Click on the menu</strong></p><p>In the Facebook mobile app, you will see a few options on the <strong>top bar</strong>. Click on the <strong>three horizontal lines</strong> on the top right. You will see a <strong>view your profile</strong> option on the top; click on it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Click on more</strong></p><p>Once you are on your profile, you have to click on the <strong>three dots</strong> on the <strong>top right</strong> to access a few options. Click on <strong>Archive</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on story archives</strong></p><p>By clicking on the <strong>More option</strong>, you will see a few more options appear. Click on the <strong>story archive</strong> option to see previous stories.</p><p>On the story archive option, you will see three dots on the top right option. It provides you with a choice to save stories or not. You can turn on the save archives option to save every story you post so that you can view it later.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-Stories-on-Facebook-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-Stories-on-Facebook-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View Stories on Facebook Desktop?"></a>Part 2: How to View Stories on Facebook Desktop?</h2><p>You can use Facebook on your desktop; it is feasible to use it on a desktop when you are using it for professional purposes such as blogging or business. It is possible to view old Facebook stories through desktop also; here is how:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Log in and open story archives</strong></p><p>You can log in to Facebook on a desktop to proceed to watch your old stories. When you log in, you have to click on your profile picture to land on your profile page. From the menu bar beneath your profile picture, you have to click on <strong>story archives</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: View old stories</strong></p><p>Once you click on the story archive, all your <strong>old stories</strong> will appear in sequential order.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only view stories through the above process if you have turned on your story archive option. Click on settings to turn it on or off as per your choice.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-View-A-Friend’s-Old-Facebook-Story"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-View-A-Friend’s-Old-Facebook-Story" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to View A Friend’s Old Facebook Story?"></a>Part 3: How to View A Friend’s Old Facebook Story?</h2><p>It is nearly impossible to view your friend’s story once it has disappeared. You cannot watch the stories even if they are achieved. However, there is one way to view old stories of your friends. Here is how:</p><p>Step 1: Visit target profile</p><p>To view your friend’s old stories, you have to <strong>visit your friend’s profile</strong> by writing their name in the search bar.</p><p><strong>Step 2: View story highlights</strong></p><p>If your friend has selected the <strong>highlights</strong> option, which is a star emoji on the bottom left. The story will be saved, and you can view it after 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Click on the right highlights</strong></p><p>People make a <strong>series of highlights</strong> and name them accordingly. If the story is about a wedding, people can name those stories’ <strong>wedding highlights</strong>. So, click on the highlight you want to view.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> A person or a user has to click on the star highlight sign to save stories for the future. If they do not select the highlight option, stories will disappear after 24 hours, and there is no way to view them in the future. Hence, this option is only applicable when a user has saved their stories for public view.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Save-Posts-from-Your-Stories-Archive-to-Your-Device"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Save-Posts-from-Your-Stories-Archive-to-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Save Posts from Your Stories Archive to Your Device?"></a>Part 4: How to Save Posts from Your Stories Archive to Your Device?</h2><p>We tend not to save stories to our devices when clicking them directly from the Facebook app. However, you can save a post to your device from the stories archive using simple steps. Let’s see how to do it:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Click on your archives</strong></p><p>When you open the Facebook mobile app, you will see your <strong>archive</strong> option on the <strong>top right</strong>.

These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.

Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests. While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.

While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings-2"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook. If you want to attract more audience, video is also a must. Here we recommend using Filmora to edit Facebook videos easily.

We believe that hashtags on Facebook are a very useful tool for marketers as they can help you attract influencers and followers. This article will go into detail about the best way to use Facebook hashtags.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Should-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags"></a>Part 1: Why You Should Use Facebook Hashtags</h2><h3 id="1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content-3"><a href="#1-Hashtags-Connect-Your-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Hashtags Connect Your Content"></a>1. Hashtags Connect Your Content</h3><p> The reason why it is so useful to use hashtags on Facebook is because they will help you connect your content with other people who may be interested in what you have to say. It is likely that other people are posting about similar topics, products or services.</p><p> Hashtags lets you form a connection with those people. Your content is easily accessible with hashtags, as anyone who is browsing through the current posts on that hashtag will see your posts.</p><h3 id="2-Expand-Your-Reach-3"><a href="#2-Expand-Your-Reach-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Expand Your Reach"></a>2. Expand Your Reach</h3><p> Using hashtags is a win-win approach on Facebook. There is no downside associated with adding a couple hashtags to every Facebook post. And the upside is huge.</p><p> A hashtag delivers expanded reach on the platform. A previous post would only be seen by followers or those who specifically search for your business name on the platform. Hashtags ensure that anyone clicking on a hashtag and browsing through the feed may come across your content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-You-Should-Know-About-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags"></a>Part 2: What You Should Know About Hashtags</h2><p> Hashtags are a concept that first started on Twitter, where individuals were able to add a # before writing a word or phrase. The hashtag is a searchable device on these social media platforms, as a person is able to click on the hashtag and see other posts that include it as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >Every hashtag that is created on Facebook has its own URL <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. When someone clicks on the hashtag, they immediately go to that page, where they can see other posts from the same hashtag.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Use-Facebook-Hashtags-Properly-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly"></a>Part 3: How to Use Facebook Hashtags Properly</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Popular-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Use-Popular-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Popular Hashtags"></a>1. Use Popular Hashtags</h3><p> The first rule to succeeding with hashtags is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamtechie.com/2013/05/an-update-on-facebook-and-hashtags/" >use ones that are already very popular <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These are branded or social community hashtags that everyone uses on a regular basis.</p><p> For instance, a hashtag such as #MotivationMonday is a common example of a popular hashtag. But a company could also use a single hashtag for all its posts, creating a branded hashtag. As the company becomes more popular, the usefulness of that hashtag would increase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-facebook-hashtags.JPG"                      alt="popular facebook hashtag"                ></p><h3 id="2-Cross-Social-Performance-3"><a href="#2-Cross-Social-Performance-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Cross Social Performance"></a>2. Cross Social Performance</h3><p> A useful side effect of Facebook adding hashtags is that you can now create more posts that are applicable to all the major social networks. Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events-3"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests.

Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage.

Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji.

On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices.

Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.</p><p>Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apple-memoji-collection.jpg"                      alt="Apple Memoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.apple.com</p><p>FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png"                      alt="Bitmoji Collection"                ></p><p>source：support.bitmoji.com</p><p>To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.</p><p>Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-avatar-collection.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Avatar Collection"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.wptv.com/" >www.wptv.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Own-FB-Avatar-A-Step-By-Step-Guide-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide"></a>How to Create Your Own FB Avatar: A Step-By-Step Guide</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Latest-Version-of-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook"></a>Step-1:Download the Latest Version of Facebook</h4><p>The foremost thing you need to do is ensure you have the newest version of Facebook.

It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’</p><p>The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.</p><p>As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.</p><p>Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.</p><p>Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.</p><p>Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!</p><p>People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1574708892866390&ref=sharing" >Lad Saves Squirrel Having A Seizure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art"><a href="#Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 5: This Master Is Genius!

This video’s like and react count has reached an amazing 555k even though it was published on 2nd December 2021.</p><p>The video features a female model and a master sculptor who uses body silicone to cover up the model’s upper body and then covers the silicone with plaster bandages to harden and give shape and strength to the mold.</p><p>Later, he uses a gypsum mix to fill the mold, and then as it dries, he extracts the finished sculpture from the mold.</p><p>In the second part, he covers the face and head of the model, first with Vaseline and then the same body silicone. Vaseline is introduced, so the silicone does not stick to the face and is easier to take off as the mold dries. After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!</p><p>Artistic videos have been seen to grasp a growing number of viewers and have started to top the charts!

This video was, once again, uploaded by the Facebook page ‘LADbible’ on 4th December 2021. It has collected a total view count of more than 72 million. The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.</p><p>The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.</p><p>First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal.

If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1574708892866390&ref=sharing" >Lad Saves Squirrel Having A Seizure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art-2"><a href="#Video-Number-5-This-Master-Is-Genius-Realistic-Gypsum-Sculpture-Art-2" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 5: This Master Is Genius!

Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.</p><p>Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.</p><p>The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.</p><p>The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.</p><p>Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=492573185317161&ref=sharing" >Chef Loves Pranking His Customers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-2"><a href="#Video-Number-8-Incredible-Moments-At-Sea-2" class="headerlink" title="Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea"></a>Video Number 8: Incredible Moments At Sea</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-8.jpg"                      alt="Incredible Moments At Sea"                ></p><p>The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in.

That was probably the only scary bit.</p><p>Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.</p><p>Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.</p><p>Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.</p><p>In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.</p><p>The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.</p><p>All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=796028924464858&ref=sharing" >Incredible Moments At Sea <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-Attractive-Facebook-Videos-WonderShare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora"></a>How to Make Attractive Facebook Videos | WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>There are many ways to enhance your content if you are a Facebook Video uploader.

In that case, you can also add transitions from the umpteen options available in WonderShare Filmora and even add subtitles or captions to your videos.</p><p>Another tip is to make sure your video is not too long as the viewers might get bored or skip the video. You may have noticed that all these most-watched Facebook Videos were between 3 and 4 minutes in length. That is the ideal duration for a viral video so keep that in mind.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Every year amazing content appears on the internet with improved quality and unique life perspectives. These were the most-watched videos on Facebook for 2021, and there are more to come. There must be more amazing videos that lacked viewership, and your video might also be one of them.</p><p>You can always use the techniques explained earlier to make videos. Hopefully, soon enough, with the help of your vision, unique content, and editing powers of WonderShare Filmora, your videos will also appear in the list of most-watched videos on Facebook or perhaps some other social media platform.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

Avoid bombarding your followers with too many posts.</p><ul><li><strong>Know the best times to publish your posts</strong></li></ul><p>If you run a Facebook business page, understand when your audiences are likely to be free. Scheduling posts for early morning publication and evening after work can attract more views and reads.</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain relevance in your posts</strong></li></ul><p>Your Facebook friends and followers are there because they expect certain content from you. As you schedule a post, ensure its in-line with what you advocate for or is related to your business. As in the case of KFC above, all posts are either introducing a new product or promoting an existing product.</p><ul><li><strong>Take advantage of events related to your Facebook post to as you schedule</strong></li></ul><p>Do you want to triple your audience with every Facebook post? There will always be big event related to your page. Create and optimize a post related to the event and schedule it to be published immediately after or during the event.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though scheduling Facebook posts helps save time, many people are missing the point and just setting any date and time. They don’t factor their intended results or mind using analytics to know the impact of their posts.</p><p>Now that how to schedule a post on Facebook is right at your fingertips, It’s critically important to ask yourself the following questions before you set the date and time:</p><ol><li>Why schedule this post on this date and time?</li><li>What do I expect to achieve?</li><li>Will my post find the right audience during their free time?</li></ol><p>As you answer these questions, kindly share with us how this article helped you or leave a comment on our social media platforms.</p><p><a

Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?"></a>Part 2. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?</h2><p>It is not at all shocking to see that with <strong>Facebook, your video is partially muted.</strong> This mostly happens because of the strict and non-flexible policies that Facebook has. The question here arises that what could be done in a situation where <strong>Facebook video partially muted?</strong></p><p>The coming section of this article will bring all the answers to you. We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.</p><h3 id="1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-3"><a href="#1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button. This is because you have the right to use the stock files in your videos.</p><h3 id="2-If-Video-is-Muted-3"><a href="#2-If-Video-is-Muted-3" class="headerlink" title="2. If Video is Muted"></a>2. If Video is Muted</h3><p>Another scenario is where you have posted a video on Facebook, but it has been muted, or Facebook partially removes music from your video. A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments”.</p><p>This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-2.jpg"                      alt="restore facebook video audio"                ></p><h3 id="3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-3"><a href="#3-In-Case-if-Video-has-been-Removed-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

In Case if Video has been Removed</h3><p>There are chances that Facebook might even remove your entire video from Facebook due to any kind of copyright claim. Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.</p><p>If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should ‘Dispute the Claimed Identity.’ You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Mute-Facebook-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Once found, you first have to ‘Open and Watch’ it. When the video is played, you will see three horizontal dots on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-6.jpg"                      alt="access facebook watch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you click on those three horizontal dots, a drop-down menu appears in front of you.

It has been reported sometimes that the <strong>Facebook suggested videos not showing up.</strong> In any such scenario, we always figure out a way to watch the videos, but no one bothers to know about the reasoning factors that have caused this problem.</p><p>In this section of the article, we will highlight the various reasons why Facebook suggested videos are not showing up.</p><h3 id="1-Improper-Launching-3"><a href="#1-Improper-Launching-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Improper Launching"></a>1. Improper Launching</h3><p>One resulting factor that might cause your <strong>Facebook suggested videos not to show up</strong> is the improper launch of the application. Sometimes improper launch hinders your way and blocks the view of suggested videos.</p><p>You should always try to treat the problem on time. You are suggested to follow the given solutions for this particular problem because you never know what might work for you. First of all, you should log out from Facebook, and you can also delete the browser completely. After that, you should install it fresh. You should also restart your system. Then give it some time to work properly.</p><h3 id="2-Poor-Network-Signals-3"><a href="#2-Poor-Network-Signals-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Network Signals"></a>2. Poor Network Signals</h3><p>A very common reason observed for <strong>FB suggested videos not showing up</strong> is the weak connection. This is the most accurate reason for many Facebook problems. Not just this issue but with poor network signals, you might also face some other troubles.</p><p>The best thing to tackle this problem is selecting a good and strong connection environment. With this solution, you can avoid many other problems as well, including this problem. With a stronger network connection, refresh the page because it increases the chance to view the videos.</p><h3 id="3-Insufficient-Space-3"><a href="#3-Insufficient-Space-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Insufficient Space"></a>3. Insufficient Space</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, there is a complete section of random entertaining videos. It consists of hundreds of videos that it has to buffer at once. Facebook videos need buffering to get played, and for that, they require quite the space.</p><p>If you don’t have sufficient space, this might be the resulting factor for <strong>Facebook suggested videos not showing up.</strong> This is the reason that causes the delay in loading the videos on time.</p><h3 id="4-Cache-problems-3"><a href="#4-Cache-problems-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Cache problems"></a>4. Cache problems</h3><p>A corrupt cache is another big reason why your Fb suggested videos don’t show up. Cache or even the cookies also slow down the performance of your favorite application. As with corrupt cache and cookies, the application does not work like it usually works efficiently.</p><p>For this scenario, the suggested solution is to stop Facebook forcefully. Once that is done, now it’s time to clear and empty the cache for applications’ better performance.</p><h3 id="5-Update-Required-3"><a href="#5-Update-Required-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Update Required"></a>5. Update Required</h3><p>The last reason that might be causing this problem is the old version of Facebook. This tip is specifically for iPhone and also Android users. This trouble is very common as most people forget to Update the applications, which in return causes some problems.</p><p>One such problem is <strong>FB suggested videos not showing up.</strong> In this case, all the Android and iPhone users should update Facebook and then check the suggested videos after an update.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Facebook-Determine-Which-Videos-Are-Suggested-for-You-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Facebook-Determine-Which-Videos-Are-Suggested-for-You-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Facebook Determine Which Videos Are Suggested for You?"></a>Part 2. How Does Facebook Determine Which Videos Are Suggested for You?</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Facebook has a section where various hundreds of videos are available. You can easily access that tab and enjoy and entertain yourself with those videos.

Let’s get started.</p><h3 id="1-Videos-Popularity-3"><a href="#1-Videos-Popularity-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Videos Popularity"></a>1. Videos Popularity</h3><p>The number 1 reason that how could some random videos make their way to your suggested videos is the popularity of any particular video. If you find any unusual video in your videos section, then the first thing that should come to your mind is that the video is popular all over Facebook and the internet.</p><p>Any video that offers entertainment, good and quality content, motivation quotes or speech, some kind of love-hate poetry. Even compilation videos of different sports, matches, funny moments, and a lot more things can fall in this category that gets the fame.</p><p>So, any famous or trending video that a lot of Facebook users have viewed, shared, liked, or commented on will automatically make its way to your and others’ suggested video tab. This is how random videos show up in your suggested videos.</p><h3 id="2-People-and-Pages-You-Follow-3"><a href="#2-People-and-Pages-You-Follow-3" class="headerlink" title="2. People and Pages You Follow"></a>2. People and Pages You Follow</h3><p>Another factor that aids in bringing random videos to your Facebook suggested videos section is whom you follow and like. Like the real world, Facebook is that platform where every person has their own identify, their accounts. Every business, different startups have their pages. Influencers have pages from where they can spread their voice through their content.</p><p>Being Facebook users, we follow different pages and follow different people as well. We add different friends on Facebook as it is the social media platform that aims to provide connectivity. So hence, in simple words, we are surrounded by many different personalities who have entirely different approaches, preferences, likes, and dislikes.</p><p>Several videos in your suggested video section come from the people and pages you are surrounded by. The pages and people whom you follow there liked and viewed videos end up in your videos section too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-You-Customize-the-Suggested-Videos-Yourself-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-You-Customize-the-Suggested-Videos-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

We suggest you follow the steps given below, and you will easily customize the videos.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first and basic step for this customization is opening Facebook on your mobile device. Then, locate the ‘Watch’ option from the Facebook shortcut bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-2.jpg"                      alt="access facebook app watch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In the watch section, you are supposed to head over to your favorite video. You will see three-horizontal dots on top of every video; click on that. Upon clicking, a drop-down menu will show up on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on three dots"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From that drop-down menu, you are required to select the ‘See More’ option. With this option, you are more like following that page and telling Facebook that you prefer to watch these videos, and this is how your favorite videos are customized to stay on top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-4.jpg"                      alt="click on see more button"                ></p><h3 id="For-Computer-3"><a href="#For-Computer-3" class="headerlink" title="For Computer"></a>For Computer</h3><p>For computer Facebook users, you can also customize your suggested videos with 3 easy steps. Given below are the steps to guide you for this type of customization.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start with opening the browser and logging in to your Facebook account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-5.jpg"                      alt="login your facebook account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, head over to the ‘Watch’ section and scroll down and look for your favorite video. Once found, you first have to ‘Open and Watch’ it. When the video is played, you will see three horizontal dots on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-suggested-videos-not-showing-up-6.jpg"                      alt="access facebook watch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you click on those three horizontal dots, a drop-down menu appears in front of you.
