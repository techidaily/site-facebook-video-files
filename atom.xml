There are no strings attached to this method. The process is as simple as it can get. The steps include:</p><p>Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on “Settings” from the context menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="access chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: The “Settings” will open. Hit “Privacy and Security” and then “Clear Browsing Data.” Select the desired time range and tick mark all options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on clear browsing data"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press “Clear Data,” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="clear your browser data"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>The browser extensions are often added to work effectively. But they do not work all the time and create problems for the normal workability of the Facebook app. Disabling the browser extensions is the right way to clear the <strong>FB full-screen problem.</strong> The steps are:</p><p>Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on “Settings” and then head-to-head to the “Extensions” from “Main Tools.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-5.jpg"                      alt="open chrome extensions"                ></p><p>Step 2: Disable the extensions by toggling them off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-6.jpg"                      alt="disable your chrome extension"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139557/4704" target="_top" id="2139557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139557/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Method 3: Disabling Hardware Acceleration</strong></p><p>The enabled Hardware Acceleration enhances the operation of different programs used on the browser.

The steps include:</p><p>Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on “Settings” from the context menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="access chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: The “Settings” will open.

If you visit that page, Facebook’s algorithm will auto-generate a video of your profile history. It will show the year you joined Facebook, your most-liked photos, statuses with the most engagement, accompanied with a standard piece of music.</p><p> It’s pretty cool. But unfortunately, Facebook’s choice of pictures isn’t. You may have to see some embarrassing old photos, or status updates that were funny at the time. In that case, you need to select the pictures of your choice, right?</p><p> The good new is that, Facebook has introduced a new editor now, which lets you choose your favorite images for the video. To edit the Look Back video, simply hit the “Edit” button on the top right corner of the Look Back page. Then un-check the photos and updates you don’t want in your video, and check the ones that you want include. Once you’re done, click the green “Share Your Movie” button at the top of the page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/edit-look-back-video.png"                      alt="edit look back video" title="edit look back video"                ></p><p> Now you’ve selected the image you like.
