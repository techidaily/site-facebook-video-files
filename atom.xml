Below, we look at some troubleshooting tips you can try when events are not showing up in the Calendar app.</p><h2 id="1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events"><a href="#1-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-All-Events" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing All Events"></a>1. Ensure Your Calendar Is Syncing All Events</h2><p> If you’re using a non-iCloud account on your phone, your Calendar may have trouble finding your past events. You might also face this problem if you created the event on a different device.</p><p> The trick is to make sure you sync and show more than just the events that happened in the last few weeks or months. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Open<strong>Settings</strong> , scroll down, and tap on<strong>Calendar</strong> .</li><li>Select<strong>Sync</strong> and choose<strong>All Events</strong> from the list of available options.</li><li>Now, wait for a minute and launch the Calendar app. Then, tap<strong>Calendars</strong> at the bottom and swipe down from the top to refresh all your calendars.</li></ol><p> If the<strong>All Events</strong> option is already selected, you can choose any of the other timeframes, restart the Calendar app, then select<strong>All Events</strong> again.​​​</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-settings-page-3.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Settings page"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-settings-3.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of iPhone calendar settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendar-sync-settings-2.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendar sync settings-2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendars tab"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud"><a href="#2-Ensure-Your-Calendar-Is-Syncing-With-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="2.

Ensure All Your Calendars Are Enabled</h2><p> One of the nifty features of the Calendar app in iOS is the ability to set up several calendars for different purposes. You can set up a shared calendar that lets you and your partner schedule date nights, for example, while also making a work calendar that helps you organize your meetings.</p><p> So, there’s a chance your events are missing because they belong to a different group. You have to make sure all your calendars are enabled to prevent that. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Launch the<strong>Calendar</strong> app and tap<strong>Calendars</strong> at the bottom of your screen.</li><li>Ensure you select the calendar groups that are important and are associated with the missing event.</li><li>Also, ensure you select<strong>Show Declined Events</strong> so any past events you didn’t accept will appear in your search for the missing event.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of calendars tab"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-of-bottom-half-of-calendars-tab.jpg"                      alt="screenshot of bottom half of calendars tab"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Try-Some-General-Troubleshooting-Tips"><a href="#4-Try-Some-General-Troubleshooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="4.

But things must have been too confusing! Pre-recorded video is where you already have a video on your device.</p><p>Likewise, live video means streaming something that’s current and ongoing. So, the combination of both may not seem possible. Fortunately, that’s not the case. If you have a video on your device and want to stream it live on Facebook, there are ways to do so. Also, there is no such tech-hassle to perform this process.</p><p>Just some simple steps would do!

Having billions of users within the platform, Facebook has gained a lot of traction over the years. Understanding the diversity of the market within the platform, there are a lot of problems that are associated with the system too. One unethical explanation of the problems faced by people is the virus associating the Facebook message of “Is That You.”</p><p>Facebook viruses are generally computer viruses that are countered by your device; however, there are also other viruses referred to as a social engineering scam people fall into within the platform. This article is subjectively discussing the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and provides a detailed explanation of how people are facing such threatful circumstances, putting their accounts and privacy under threat.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Types of Facebook Viruses that Can be Spotted</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Facebook-Viruses-that-Can-be-Spotted"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Facebook-Viruses-that-Can-be-Spotted" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Types of Facebook Viruses that Can be Spotted"></a>Part 1: Types of Facebook Viruses that Can be Spotted</h2><p>There is a numerous variety of Facebook viruses that we can think of; however, the <strong>Facebook video scam,</strong> in general, is focused on breaching the user’s privacy. These viruses are easily recognized and tracked, making it simple for people to protect themselves on this social platform. These malware and viruses are given the room to barge into the platform with the bugs countered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-1.jpg"                      alt="types of facebook scam"                ></p><p>However, the only responsibility of recognizing and reporting the viruses is to look into the types, which would explain quite much to the users how they need to assess the situation and protect themselves from the problems this can cause.</p><h3 id="Personal-Messages-with-Urgency"><a href="#Personal-Messages-with-Urgency" class="headerlink" title="Personal Messages with Urgency"></a>Personal Messages with Urgency</h3><p>Social engineers utilize their skills to express urgency across Facebook messages to gain users’ personal information. Although <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> is different kind of scam, such types are more confusing and irritating to counter. Urgent personal messages have been an effective form of viruses fraudsters have used to gain personal information from Facebook messages.</p><p>This form of the virus has turned out to be a conventional virus type; however, only a single download was what could breach your personal information. Your account would be breached over a single click, and you’ll be countering a problem that might never get easy on you.</p><h3 id="Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses"><a href="#Facebook-Video-Scam-Viruses" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Video Scam Viruses"></a>Facebook Video Scam Viruses</h3><p><strong>Facebook video scam</strong> has been at the forefront of viruses, where it has breached a lot of users’ privacy with its simple yet effective technique of gaining personal information. Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.</p><p>Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.</p><h3 id="Fake-Facebook-Applications"><a href="#Fake-Facebook-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Fake Facebook Applications"></a>Fake Facebook Applications</h3><p>People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications. The renowned icon has been copied and utilized in different forms, which, if downloaded, traps the user into the virus. If installed and opened, this virus leads you into one of the biggest and most threatening conditions.</p><p>The user who gives authorized permissions to such applications gets their phones breached to the root. A single click to installation puts your complete profile under an inadvertent threat.</p><h3 id="Spam-Posts"><a href="#Spam-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Spam Posts"></a>Spam Posts</h3><p>Unusual posts across Facebook’s timeline are another form of gaining access to your account credentials. Posts that seem too good to be true or have unrealistic patterns usually put people’s profiles at risk if accessed potentially. If clicked across these posts, these online links and spam links are the killers to your profile.</p><p>Users are usually advised to report these posts on observing such suspicious activities. Although, a few put their profile at risk for winning a chance in the “online lottery.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-“Is-That-You”-Facebook-Virus-and-What-Does-it-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?"></a>Part 2: What is the “Is That You” Facebook Virus and What Does it Do?</h2><p>The main idea of the “Is That You” Facebook video virus is to breach the users’ privacy and take in potential information that would effectively harm the image or the profile security. There is a need to look into the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and dissect all the possibilities that associate the situation and the possibilities it brings for the hackers behind it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-2.jpg"                      alt="is that you fb scam"                ></p><h3 id="What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message"><a href="#What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message" class="headerlink" title="What Happens After You Click the Link or Message"></a>What Happens After You Click the Link or Message</h3><p>This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams. Users are tricked into giving their confidential credit card details, leading to monetary threats and scams. It has been reported that users have potentially lost money due to this mistake of letting hackers go into the account.</p><p>The developers of these viruses have an objective of personal gains out of these kinds of viruses, which can be quite a botheration for the users. The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</h2><p>Considering you have been victim to such a <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> virus, or you wish to take preventive measures to save yourselves from such problems, there are a set of different techniques which should be followed to make your life free from such deceptive and destructive viruses.

Having billions of users within the platform, Facebook has gained a lot of traction over the years.

Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.</p><p>Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.</p><h3 id="Fake-Facebook-Applications-3"><a href="#Fake-Facebook-Applications-3" class="headerlink" title="Fake Facebook Applications"></a>Fake Facebook Applications</h3><p>People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications.

There is a need to look into the <strong>“It’s You in this Video” Facebook message</strong> and dissect all the possibilities that associate the situation and the possibilities it brings for the hackers behind it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-video-scam-2.jpg"                      alt="is that you fb scam"                ></p><h3 id="What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message-3"><a href="#What-Happens-After-You-Click-the-Link-or-Message-3" class="headerlink" title="What Happens After You Click the Link or Message"></a>What Happens After You Click the Link or Message</h3><p>This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams. Users are tricked into giving their confidential credit card details, leading to monetary threats and scams. It has been reported that users have potentially lost money due to this mistake of letting hackers go into the account.</p><p>The developers of these viruses have an objective of personal gains out of these kinds of viruses, which can be quite a botheration for the users. The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue-3"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</h2><p>Considering you have been victim to such a <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> virus, or you wish to take preventive measures to save yourselves from such problems, there are a set of different techniques which should be followed to make your life free from such deceptive and destructive viruses.

Facebook warns its users of the possible risks before redirecting to another website; however, this has been one of the most confusing viruses. Users usually fail to realize the threats associated with moving towards other websites.</p><p>Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.</p><h3 id="Fake-Facebook-Applications"><a href="#Fake-Facebook-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Fake Facebook Applications"></a>Fake Facebook Applications</h3><p>People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications.

This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways.

The only explanation for users to stay safe from such viruses is to avoid clicking links without a clear understanding of what they are accessing. Such links lead to imitations of renowned websites, which can put you in excessive difficulties if confused with the original.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Prevention-Techniques-and-Follow-Ups-After-This-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Prevention Techniques and Follow-Ups After This Issue?</h2><p>Considering you have been victim to such a <strong>Facebook video scam</strong> virus, or you wish to take preventive measures to save yourselves from such problems, there are a set of different techniques which should be followed to make your life free from such deceptive and destructive viruses.

Facebook short videos have gained a lot of attention ever since the launch of this feature.</p><p>This feature was predominantly launched in India as a part of a testing phase and has proven to be a quite successful venture by Facebook. The short videos on Facebook also have a 30 second to 45 second run time, making them more user-friendly.</p><p>Quite recently, steps towards Facebook short video monetization have been taken. A major chunk of Facebook’s revenue is generated through ads. So, a user will get money for each user then watches the Facebook short video ad played right after their 30 – 45 second video.</p><p>The more viewers and followers a user has the chances of their net earnings being higher. The best way to do that is to make more engaging content; it should be socially oriented and creative.</p><p>You can also choose a particular faction of the audience and make audience-specific content. You could make music-related content for music lovers, poetry-related content for poetry lovers, and so on.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Reels, Snapchat discover, and short videos on Facebook are becoming the next big thing. The 30 – 45 second videos are leaving a huge impact on both the suppliers and consumers. Facebook generates revenue by monetizing these short videos, and the content creators get in touch with the world.</p><p>Although the young generation has shifted to Instagram and Snapchat, the previous generation still relies on Facebook, making introducing this feature in that sphere crucial. Short videos on Facebook have gained immense popularity in India and will continue to grow.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

These photos tell viewers to move their phone around to get details about surroundings. The trend of sharing regular photos on Facebook has gone now and future is all about 360 content.</p><p> As we all know that 360 photos or videos are captured from special cameras that have 360 degree capability. So, most of you might be thinking that you may need to spend a lot to stay tuned to this feature on your device. But the truth is that you need not to buy any expensive camera unit to produce 360 photos for your Facebook post. It doesn’t even require a special 360 degree app to upload interactive pictures.</p><p> Probably you have a tablet or phone that support Facebook live 360 video feature. Actually as per the recent announcement made by Facebook professionals regarding its updated applications, live 360 is compatible with all devices launched after iPad Pro. iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 or iPhone 4S models. Till now Facebook has not revealed any news related to compatibility of new features over Android devices and chances are that Android users need to wait so long to enjoy this feature on their device. However, they made a useful statement that Galaxy devices launched after Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S5 will support this feature.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App"></a>Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App</h2><p> Generally 360 degree camera is most preferable choice for developing high quality 360 degree images but in case if you don’t have one then Panorama feature of built in device cameras can make it possible. However, users cannot get focus from up and down but they can at least pan from right to left by simply swiping on their display. This feature only works for photos that mean you cannot develop 360 videos using Panorama.</p><p> If you are using iPad or iPhone then simple open your camera app and go to Panorama Shooting mode. Start capturing your photo with panoramic photo option but note that you have to follow Facebook photo dimension specifications to develop a live 360 compatible content. However, it is really hard to measure exact dimensions of a panoramic photo when you are working with default settings.</p><p> As soon as you have captured your desired shot, move to your Facebook account and browse photo library. Choose your recently captured panorama photo and then follow instructions provided on screen to update your video. You can also preview your content, now add desired caption and publish your content online. Soon your will start receiving interesting comments and reviews from audience. Users can also delete their 360 degree photos after few hours as per their need. Such types of videos are being commonly used for entertainment and marketing purpose throughout the world.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View"></a>Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View</h2><p> It is important to capture 360 degree photos in Facebook compatible formats so professionals recommend using Google’s street view camera app for this purpose. It works fine over iOS as well as Android platform and let users enjoy unlimited 360 shoots. To develop 360 degree videos from this application:</p><ul><li>First of all get it installed on your device. You will find a plus sign on your app window, hit this and then select Open Camera option. This app can provide you complete guidelines about how to capture 360 degree images. Note that users need to keep their camera still while capturing such shots.</li><li>Try to move your phone around till the time you notice orange dots on screen. As soon as these dots are there, photos will be captured automatically. There are a tick icon at bottom portion of screen that gets circular border update with every click and once you have captured complete 360 degree motion then it will go green.</li><li>When you are taking last pictures of your 360 shoot, the app will itself remind you about missing points so that you can pick them up. Users can also remove unwanted images from undo icon.</li><li>These captured 360 videos can be uploaded on Facebook same as the regular posts. Simply go to your account, move to status update and select your image, add caption and update.</li></ul><h2 id="Viewing-360-Photos-on-Facebook"><a href="#Viewing-360-Photos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Viewing 360 Photos on Facebook"></a>Viewing 360 Photos on Facebook</h2><p> As soon as you are done with the uploading process, next task is to visit your profile and check if your uploaded video is working fine or not. If you are working on a web browser then simply click on this video and drag it here and there to avail 360 degree view whereas those who are watching it on smartphone can simply move it around in all directions to enjoy 360 degree view.</p><p> You will find a small radar type icon at bottom of screen; it provides information about your current pointing position on view.

You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch?

While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go!
