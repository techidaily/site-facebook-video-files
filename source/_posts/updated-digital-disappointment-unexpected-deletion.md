## Part 1: Copyright – Explaining All Important Dynamics to this Legal Right

We have heard people saying, “**Facebook removed my video due to copyright.**” By jurisdiction of the digital community and international laws, copyright is known as a legal right that protects the original authority over the content and information developed. Any work that has been designed, developed, or created by a user has copyright over it once it has been created and deployed.

Talking about what copyright covers in its ambits, a variety of work is catered across this terminology. Any visual or audiovisual work, audio content, and literary work created by users have designated copyrights of the user responsible for its creation. The basic eligibility criteria for such content is to be original to fit the cross-fits of copyright.

This requires the content to have a minimum percentage of creativity that would cater to its plausibility to have copyright over it. However, names, slogans, and titles do not come with the possibility of having copyrights over them.

### How to Know The Content Can Have Copyrights?

On the other hand, anything that you or a client has potentially created provides you with certain copyrights over it. It explains that users can simply understand their position over how original their content is to be called copyright material.

### Rights as Copyright Owner

Since the notification mentions the content owner who filed for copyright actions, you can easily get in touch with the person to resolve the issue. You can also consider appealing the removal of your content for gaining appropriate reasons over its removal.

The information that is received by the user containing the details of the applicant filing for copyright action is provided as follows:

* Report number and owner's name.
* Email address of the reporting party.
* Details of the report and instructions to be followed, if any.
* Guide to submit an appeal

### What Happens Over Repeating Infringement

Facebook has a no-tolerance policy for users who repeatedly breach the copyright of other users' content. Under such circumstances, the platform considers disabling the account or the page is run, if any. While abiding by the rules, Facebook either restricts your posting across the platform or completely disables the account, mostly based on the extent of the infringement.

### How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?

This information is useful for users who report **Facebook video copyright** breaches of their content over someone's post. Facebook receives the email and provides you with the particular number that would act as the identification of the 'ticket' created. Once done, Facebook looks into the issue and notifies the person that has breached the copyrights.

However, under some circumstances, Facebook demands some questions for the person submitting the report, intending to know more about the case if not clarified. Once clear, clear action is taken by the authorities, with proper notifications sent to the user explaining the updates of the report.

While being across Facebook, users need to follow a set of tips that would explain how to protect themselves from violating copyright law. There are a few things that a user needs to prevent using across their posts. While focusing on these points, users would be more in control of their content.

* Refrain from using bought or downloaded content from websites, such as iTunes.
* Content that has been recorded across personal recording devices.
* Try to give credit to the owner of the content.
* Add a disclaimer that would clear the intention of using copyright content or infringing it.
* Do not intend to profit from the content.
* Try to add original content in major proportion across your content.
* Do not think that the posted content is of fair use.

Facebook has kept a no-tolerance policy for such cases and advises users to follow a set of options that would help them prevent such problems in the future.
