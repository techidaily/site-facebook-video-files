One of the most useful aspects of this software is that you are just required to copy and paste the link of the video you want to download which would automatically open in the download box. It offers full support for multiple embedded file formats. If you are not willing to dole out a lot of money then you just need to make use of the free trial version.

**Pros:**

* This application comes with easy search options for retrieving the videos once the process of download is over.

**Cons:**

* The trial version of this software lacks essential features. In order to access all the useful features of this software, you need to go for the paid version.
* It doesn’t support all the video codecs and you are required to update it every week.
