The idea that one perfect length will appeal to marketers is a myth. The ideal length works in a range. This should indicate that there is no such thing. You should experiment with the length of your ad copy. While Facebook has guidelines for its ad copies, they are not a hard and fast rule.

What works best for your ad copy varies. It depends entirely on your industry, the type of ad you have in place, and the language of the ad copy. You can increase the length of your ad copy to see how customers respond. You can shorten your ad copy to see the response. It would work best if you had a control post in place. This means you create a post with your normal ad copy length. You can use the metrics to see which one wins out. Sometimes, shorter copies are preferred by the customer. You can come across other data points to help you create a better video ad and ad copy.

### Engage with Short-Form Videos

Short-form video content is taking over the platform. They typically last between 15 seconds to 60 seconds. They're short, easily digestible, quick, and informative. On Facebook, this takes the form of Facebook Reels. The last 30 seconds. You can use a blend of text, audio, and creative effects. Reels are available primarily for mobile app users.

This can be a refreshing new way for users to find content creators. This can also help businesses build meaningful engagement with their audience. This is the predictable outcome of the popularity of TikTok. Facebook and Instagram have Reels. YouTube has come out with YouTube Shorts to enhance its attractiveness.

### Chatbots

A [Kolsky study](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/vala-afshar/50-important-customer-exp%5Fb%5F8295772.html) finds that attracting a new customer is 6-7 times more expensive than retaining a current one. The key to great customer service is promptness and knowledgeability. This is where chatbots come in handy. You can get more bang for your buck with a chatbot. If you have a customer service team, then you can use chatbots to filter out basic, tedious, and repetitive questions. Additionally, the chatbot can make the customers' experience feel personalized. The customer service reps can then handle difficult or technical queries.
