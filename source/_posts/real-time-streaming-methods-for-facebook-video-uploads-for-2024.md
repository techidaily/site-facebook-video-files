### LiveReacting

[LiveReacting](https://www.livereacting.com/) is a cloud-based tool that helps you to upload pre-recorded videos to Facebook Live.

It's an outstanding open-source platform that ensures efficient screencasting, recording, and Live streaming. Live videos get more viral than conventional videos. Thus, its popularity is obligatory.

Start by launching the Stream key to enable the use of streaming software. Do not disclose the Stream Key to anyone as it may be misused. The validity of the Stream key is around seven days.

* Click on Next and wait for the "Create Live Video" option to appear. Keep the window as it is and move on to the configuration of OBS.

* Add videos and create a playlist. Assign a name to the playlist and click on the OK button. Customize the settings on how you want to stream the video. If you want to stream even after window minimization, click on "Always play even when not visible".
* The "+" icon allows you to add multiple videos. Make sure to do so if you want to feature a list of videos. Once done, click on the Ok button and mute the Mic/Aux. Now, click on the Start Streaming button.
* Navigate to the Facebook window and click on the "Go live" button.
