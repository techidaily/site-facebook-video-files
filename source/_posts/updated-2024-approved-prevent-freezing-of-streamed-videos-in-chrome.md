### Method 1: Switch the Browser on Your Computer

Most browsers are undergoing problems related to their programming and upgrade. Using another browser from your computer is always recommended and eliminates the error.

![use different internet broswer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-not-playing-11.jpg)

### Method 2: Ensure a Working Internet Connection

**Facebook videos not playing 2020** occur due to an unstable internet connection. There are multiple devices connected to one router that reduces the speed. Ensure that you are connected to an active internet connection and offer workable speed.

### Method 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration

Browsers use hardware acceleration to bring the perfect user experience for videos preview. However, it doesn't work all the time, so disabling it feels like the right choice. To disable the hardware acceleration, go to the "Settings" from your system and head to the "Advanced" section. Toggle off "Use hardware acceleration when available."
