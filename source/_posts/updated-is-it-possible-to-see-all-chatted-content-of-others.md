## Finding Photos And Videos on Messenger Website

While the Desktop app is excellent to use when you are not using messenger on your phone, most of us just go to the messenger site and chat away. Sometimes it’s just easier to chat on your browser and not open any apps.

But, do not worry if you find it challenging to navigate the messenger website just because it is your first time or you don’t know anything about it besides how to chat.

2. Click on the names of your friends on your left to open a chatbox.

4. Then click on **Shared Media**to access all the pictures and videos that you have sent to this particular contact.
