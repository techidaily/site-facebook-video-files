## Part 2: Bonus Tip! Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook

As mentioned above, Facebook operates on a list of standards which include specific dimensions, sizes, aspect ratios, and video length. If the user fails to follow these video specs, the video wouldn't upload and will create complications. There are different specs for story videos, 360 videos, news feed, and Carousel video ads.

The standards have been set for a frictionless process. For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500\*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 â€“ 9:16\. Similarly, the resolution should be 1080\*1920 px, with a maximum file size of 4GB, and video length should be within 1 to 15 seconds.

There is a diverse range of video formats successfully applicable on Facebook. Most beginners and even advanced users don't know the formats. Henceforth, the sub-section has taken the opportunity to mention those formats other than MP4 and MOV.

* MP4 (MPEG-4 video)
