The 4th video that is the most viewed on Facebook is a sincere act of Humanity. It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’

The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.

As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.

Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.

Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.

Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!

People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.

## Video Number 5: This Master Is Genius! Realistic Gypsum Sculpture Art

![This Master Is Genius! Realistic Gypsum Sculpture Art](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg)

The 5th video in the list of most-watched Facebook videos is an artistic yet fun video by the Facebook page ‘5-Minute Crafts’. It is titled ‘This master is genius! Realistic gypsum sculpture art.’

The video has amassed over 96 million views on Facebook and 8.4k comments. This video’s like and react count has reached an amazing 555k even though it was published on 2nd December 2021.

The video features a female model and a master sculptor who uses body silicone to cover up the model’s upper body and then covers the silicone with plaster bandages to harden and give shape and strength to the mold.

Later, he uses a gypsum mix to fill the mold, and then as it dries, he extracts the finished sculpture from the mold.

In the second part, he covers the face and head of the model, first with Vaseline and then the same body silicone. Vaseline is introduced, so the silicone does not stick to the face and is easier to take off as the mold dries. After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!

Artistic videos have been seen to grasp a growing number of viewers and have started to top the charts! The link to this video is as follows:

## Video Number 7: Chef Loves Pranking His Customers

![Chef Loves Pranking His Customers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-7.jpg)

Here comes the videos for all the foodies out there. This video was, once again, uploaded by the Facebook page ‘LADbible’ on 4th December 2021\. It has collected a total view count of more than 72 million. The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.

The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.

First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.

Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.

The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.

The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.

Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!

The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.

The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021\. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’

Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!

Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.

The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.

Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.

Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.

Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.

In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.

The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.

All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!

After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!

Here comes the videos for all the foodies out there. This video was, once again, uploaded by the Facebook page ‘LADbible’ on 4th December 2021\. It has collected a total view count of more than 72 million. The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.

The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.

First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.

Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.

The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.

The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.

Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!

The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.

The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021\. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’

Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!

Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.

The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.

Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.

Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.

Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.

In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.

The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.

All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!

The 4th video that is the most viewed on Facebook is a sincere act of Humanity. It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’

The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.

As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.

Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.

Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.

Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!

People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.

## Video Number 4: Lad Saves Squirrel Having A Seizure

![Lad Saves Squirrel Having a Seizure](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg)

The 4th video that is the most viewed on Facebook is a sincere act of Humanity. It was posted on the page ‘LADbible’ on 11 December 2021 at 11:00 pm. It is titled ‘This lad acted fast when he found a squirrel having a seizure.’

The video has gained 102 million views—14 thousand likes and reactions, along with 1.2k comments.

As the title suggests, the video features a young chap named Leo who finds a squirrel having a seizure. He has to act fast and surely does; he grabs some paper towels, gently lifts the squirrel and lays it on the paper towels.

Leo then gives the little squirrel the medical attention he needs and even tries to perform CPR on the squirrel. He then rushes to get some water and uses a straw and a syringe to put water in the unconscious squirrel’s mouth.

Later, he and his sister give the squirrel some water with sugar in, with the animal twitches a little bit but is unresponsive. After a while, they try to give him some fruits, and the little squirrel slowly revives and regains consciousness.

Leo keeps the squirrel in a cage overnight so it can fully recover without the potential danger of any predator that may harm, and later on, the squirrel is seen to be fully recovered!

People like Leo keep our belief in humanity and make us believe that humanity still exists. If it was not for him and his sister, the poor sick animal might have died.

![This Master Is Genius! Realistic Gypsum Sculpture Art](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg)

The 5th video in the list of most-watched Facebook videos is an artistic yet fun video by the Facebook page ‘5-Minute Crafts’. It is titled ‘This master is genius! Realistic gypsum sculpture art.’

The video has amassed over 96 million views on Facebook and 8.4k comments. This video’s like and react count has reached an amazing 555k even though it was published on 2nd December 2021.

The video features a female model and a master sculptor who uses body silicone to cover up the model’s upper body and then covers the silicone with plaster bandages to harden and give shape and strength to the mold.

Later, he uses a gypsum mix to fill the mold, and then as it dries, he extracts the finished sculpture from the mold.

In the second part, he covers the face and head of the model, first with Vaseline and then the same body silicone. Vaseline is introduced, so the silicone does not stick to the face and is easier to take off as the mold dries. After that, the mold is again poured with gypsum mix, and an exquisite sculpture is ready!

Artistic videos have been seen to grasp a growing number of viewers and have started to top the charts! The link to this video is as follows:

## Video Number 7: Chef Loves Pranking His Customers

![Chef Loves Pranking His Customers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-most-viewed-videos-on-facebook-7.jpg)

Here comes the videos for all the foodies out there. This video was, once again, uploaded by the Facebook page ‘LADbible’ on 4th December 2021\. It has collected a total view count of more than 72 million. The likes and reactions counter has reached 10 thousand along with 729 comments.

The video is titled ‘This chef loves pranking his customers.’ It features a Hibachi chef in a restaurant somewhere in America who loves pulling off pranks and jokes on his customers.

First of all, if you don’t know what Hibachi is, Hibachi is a traditional Japanese heating device. Originally, it was only used for heating and was powered by coal. It is a brazier in a round, cylindrical shape or a box-shaped container with an open top.

Modern-day hibachis are now electric and are commonly used in restaurants around the United States of America so that they can be used to cook food indoors without the black smoke that comes from the burning of coal.

The chef is seen working around one of the hibachis and cracks jokes on his customers, both verbal and practical. The customers seem to be enjoying a lot as the chef tosses one of his cooking utensils towards a person but catches it mid-air because of his expertise.

The customers get scared and then laugh hysterically once they realize that they have been pranked.

Regardless of age, the chef is seen as pranking people of middle age, young kids, and even elders. That is a very cool and fun experience provided by the chef and the restaurant to their diners to have come out to have a fun night out along with great food!

The final video in the series of 8 most-watched videos on Facebook is truly amazing and gives us a phenomenal experience of the world we live in. Away from land, in the middle of the ocean! Yes! It features incredible moments at sea.

The video was uploaded again by the Facebook page ‘UNILAD’ on 6th October 2021\. It is titled ‘If you’re not already scared of the sea, you will be after this….’

Contrary to the title, it features extraordinary views and perspectives at sea, and the video has amassed over 70 million views despite being at the end of the list. That is a great number!

Along with the 70 million views, more than 334 thousand people have liked and reacted to this video, and over 40 thousand people have commented. The video shows nature at its best as it features marine life such as dolphins, sea lions, whales, and other small fish that live in the depths of the sea.

The first clip features a cruise ship hit by huge waves, and water splashes all over the ship, but then the wave disappears, and the water starts to disappear. That was probably the only scary bit.

Following this clip, there are several clips where a pod of dolphins is seen diving in and out close to the ocean’s surface, and a whale is also seen diving among them.

Another clip shows a massive humpback whale diving out of the water to breathe in some air and diving right back in, creating huge waves. It is truly a mesmerizing and spectacular view to experience.

Towards the end, a sea lion is shown to be grabbing the deck of a boat and demanding treats. A little kid and his dad on the boat offer him some fish which he eats happily and then takes off back into the sea.

In the end, there are two clips, one of a surfer who is on his surfboard and sees a dolphin swimming right below the surface and seems to be following him.

The last video features a pet dog on the boat, which is excited to see a dolphin swimming in the waters for the first time.

All these are truly appealing and once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and we are lucky cameras exist, and someone captured these moments!
