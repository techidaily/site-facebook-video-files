Apple’s streaming box is a part of the Apple Ecosystem, and it works like a charm with your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can stream movies, TV shows, listen to podcasts, and music from Apple Music and Pandora.

Apple TV comes in different models to bring innovation and advanced features for its loyal customers. The first one is Apple TV 4K which is considered the flagship Apple TV model. Offering an A10 processor and supporting 4K and HDR videos, this is the right choice for your perfect streaming experience.

The next on the list is Apple TV (4TH Generation) that supports 1080p HD video and comes up with an A8 processor. You can count on this model to upgrade your television in the future. Moreover, it doubles the processor's speed and quadruples the graphics speed.
