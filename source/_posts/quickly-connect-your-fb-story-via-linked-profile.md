## Part 5: How to Add A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story?

Facebook stories offer another feature, which is known as the Swipe Up Link. On some pages, you might have seen that their stories ask you to Swipe Up, and once you do that, you get redirected to a website. This fantastic feature is available for Facebook pages with a good number of followers and many likes. Else, the swipe-up link feature is available for people with the Blue tick, which means celebrities, brands, and famous people. Here’s how to add a swipe-up link to your Facebook story.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Facebook account and go to your Facebook page to add the swipe-up link.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the + icon that you can see on the profile picture. After that, you need to click on the Create Story option.
