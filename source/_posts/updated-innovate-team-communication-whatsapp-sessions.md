Video conferencing is the latest form of communication that people all over the world have adopted. Especially during the Covid-19 days, video calls and conferences were the only way people could interact with each other face to face.

So, with the changing communication dynamics, different social media platforms leveled up their game. Many tech companies have already offered video conferencing features such as Google with Google Meets, Microsoft with Skype and Teams, Zoom, etc. However, Facebook lacked in this department.

So, in April of 2020, Facebook rolled out its latest feature called Messenger Rooms.

In this article, we will give you an overview of what Facebook Messenger Rooms are and how you can create them for individual use and group chats.

#### In this article

Part 3: [How Can I Create a Messenger Room for a Group?](#step3)

## Part 1\. Overview of Messenger Room

Messenger Rooms is a video conferencing platform introduced by Facebook. You can create a room via Facebook or Messenger to spend quality time with people online.

You can use this platform to create a Facebook video chat room where you can interact with your friends, family, and acquaintances. Messenger Rooms make it extremely easy to host celebrations, gather a book club, or chill on the couch with anyone from your Facebook network.

### Features of Messenger Rooms

Since Messenger Rooms is a recent release in the world of video conferencing platforms, it has more advanced and thought-out features than the rest of the video conferencing apps. Let’s look at some of the cool features Messenger Rooms has to offer.

**Feature 1: Facebook Account Not Required**

The best feature of the Messenger Rooms is that you do not need a Facebook account to join a room. Anyone can join the conversation as long as they have the link to the room.

**Feature 2: Unlimited Calls**

Unlike Zoom, Messenger Rooms do not have any time limit to the calls. You can talk to your friends and family for as long as you want without any disruption.

**Feature 3: Capacity of 50 People**

Another feature of the Messenger Rooms is that they can hold up to a maximum of 50 people. So, you host huge gatherings as well!

**Feature 4: Effects and Filters**

Effects and filters make everything seem more fun and fuller of life. So, Messenger Rooms’ feature of different effects, filters, themed events, and mood lighting makes the video chat more enjoyable for the viewers. It also allows you to add a virtual background of your choice.

**Feature 5: Lock or Unlock the Room**

Due to the privacy concerns of many, Messenger Rooms gives the host the option to lock or unlock the room. It gives the host the ability to control who sees the room and who doesn’t.

If the room is unlocked, anyone with the link can join and share the room with others. You can lock the room as soon as everyone you invite has joined so that unnecessary people don't disturb you.

**Feature 6: Host’s Control**

Learning from the mistakes of other applications, Messenger Room ensures that the host has a control from the start. A call cannot begin without the host. The host has the power to control who can join the room, who can see the room, and they can also remove participants at any time.

This helps create a safe and secure environment for the host and the guests.

**Feature 7: Reporting Rooms**

Facebook keeps the safety of its users at top priority. Therefore, if you see something that violates [Facebook’s Community Standards](https://web.facebook.com/communitystandards/), you can report the room name. The report will not include the audio and video from the room as it may be considered a breach of privacy.

**Feature 8: Blocked Users**

If you have blocked someone on Facebook, they won’t be able to join the same room as you (only if both of you are logged in to your accounts).

On the other hand, if you have blocked someone's messages and calls on Messenger, you will be notified if you are about to join a room with the person you have blocked.

**Feature 9: Broadcast Rooms**

You can also broadcast your room using the Facebook Live feature. In such a case, the room is shared to Facebook, and people outside the room can also see what’s happening in it.

Facebook also collects audio and videos from broadcast rooms in order to ensure that users are following [Community Standards.](https://web.facebook.com/communitystandards/)

**Feature 10: Safety Guidelines**

Last but not least, Facebook cares about its users. So it has provided a guideline on [how to stay safe](https://web.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/292968301883130?locale=en%5FUS&draft=292968301883130) while using Messenger Rooms.

### How Do Messenger Rooms Help People?

Messenger Rooms is an ideal platform for people as it offers safety, security, and privacy. Users of Facebook can easily conversate via group video calls and share interests with others. This helps in creating an inclusive and friendly environment.

People with social anxiety can also interact with the community without coming out of their comfort zone.

Furthermore, it is easy to use and readily accessible for people all over the world.

With all the cool features and benefits that Messenger Rooms offer, we're sure you are wondering how to create one. Well, wonder no more! We have given complete instructions that will help you create a Facebook Messenger Room.

## Part 1\. Overview of Messenger Room

Messenger Rooms is a video conferencing platform introduced by Facebook. You can create a room via Facebook or Messenger to spend quality time with people online.

You can use this platform to create a Facebook video chat room where you can interact with your friends, family, and acquaintances. Messenger Rooms make it extremely easy to host celebrations, gather a book club, or chill on the couch with anyone from your Facebook network.

### Features of Messenger Rooms

Since Messenger Rooms is a recent release in the world of video conferencing platforms, it has more advanced and thought-out features than the rest of the video conferencing apps. Let’s look at some of the cool features Messenger Rooms has to offer.

**Feature 1: Facebook Account Not Required**

The best feature of the Messenger Rooms is that you do not need a Facebook account to join a room. Anyone can join the conversation as long as they have the link to the room.

**Feature 2: Unlimited Calls**

Unlike Zoom, Messenger Rooms do not have any time limit to the calls. You can talk to your friends and family for as long as you want without any disruption.

**Feature 3: Capacity of 50 People**

Another feature of the Messenger Rooms is that they can hold up to a maximum of 50 people. So, you host huge gatherings as well!

**Feature 4: Effects and Filters**

Effects and filters make everything seem more fun and fuller of life. So, Messenger Rooms’ feature of different effects, filters, themed events, and mood lighting makes the video chat more enjoyable for the viewers. It also allows you to add a virtual background of your choice.

**Feature 5: Lock or Unlock the Room**

Due to the privacy concerns of many, Messenger Rooms gives the host the option to lock or unlock the room. It gives the host the ability to control who sees the room and who doesn’t.

If the room is unlocked, anyone with the link can join and share the room with others. You can lock the room as soon as everyone you invite has joined so that unnecessary people don't disturb you.

**Feature 6: Host’s Control**

Learning from the mistakes of other applications, Messenger Room ensures that the host has a control from the start. A call cannot begin without the host. The host has the power to control who can join the room, who can see the room, and they can also remove participants at any time.

This helps create a safe and secure environment for the host and the guests.

**Feature 7: Reporting Rooms**

Facebook keeps the safety of its users at top priority. Therefore, if you see something that violates [Facebook’s Community Standards](https://web.facebook.com/communitystandards/), you can report the room name. The report will not include the audio and video from the room as it may be considered a breach of privacy.

**Feature 8: Blocked Users**

If you have blocked someone on Facebook, they won’t be able to join the same room as you (only if both of you are logged in to your accounts).

On the other hand, if you have blocked someone's messages and calls on Messenger, you will be notified if you are about to join a room with the person you have blocked.

**Feature 9: Broadcast Rooms**

You can also broadcast your room using the Facebook Live feature. In such a case, the room is shared to Facebook, and people outside the room can also see what’s happening in it.

Facebook also collects audio and videos from broadcast rooms in order to ensure that users are following [Community Standards.](https://web.facebook.com/communitystandards/)

**Feature 10: Safety Guidelines**

Last but not least, Facebook cares about its users. So it has provided a guideline on [how to stay safe](https://web.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/292968301883130?locale=en%5FUS&draft=292968301883130) while using Messenger Rooms.

### How Do Messenger Rooms Help People?

Messenger Rooms is an ideal platform for people as it offers safety, security, and privacy. Users of Facebook can easily conversate via group video calls and share interests with others. This helps in creating an inclusive and friendly environment.

Furthermore, it is easy to use and readily accessible for people all over the world.

![Invite People](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-messenger-rooms-20.jpg)

Click on the “Share Link” to invite people outside your Facebook network. Once you do that, the auto-share feature will give you the option to share it across different apps.

**Step 7: Explore Different Options.**

Once people start joining in, you can start interacting. Other options available to you are turning on/off the speaker or mic. You can also minimize the room by clicking on the arrow on the top left.

**Step 7: Set the Desired Settings**

You can only invite people within the group.

**Step 8: Enjoy the Room!**

Once people have joined, start your meeting or fun, or both!

## Side note

Videos are a very effective way of expressing yourself. If you wish to upload your own videos to Facebook, we recommend a video editor called Wondershare Filmora. Make a video and then use Wondershare Filmora and its multitude of features to edit the video.

With Filmora, your videos can be raised to the professional level and help you interact with a larger audience.

## Conclusion

Facebook is an ages-old social media website, but it still manages to stay updated with the world. Introducing the Messenger Rooms was also a show of its efficiency.

Messenger Rooms are a hit among people as they are fun, interactive, easy to use, and accessible. The best part is that they offer many features such as security, privacy, control, and many more. We rarely find such all-rounded apps.

Therefore, we should not take them for granted and use them to their full capacity. So, get the Messenger app or log in to Facebook and start your room!

Happy Calling!!
