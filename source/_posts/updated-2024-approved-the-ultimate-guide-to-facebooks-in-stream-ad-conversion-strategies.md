As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, **FB instream ads** have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.

**Pre-Roll Ads**

Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.
