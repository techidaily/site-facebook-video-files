Part 2: [How Can You Share Tik Tok Videos to Facebook on iPhone or iPad?](#step2)

Part 3: [How Can YouShare Tik Tok Videos to Facebook without Watermark](#step3)

## Part 1: Social Media Integration

The Social Media Industry has grown exponentially with a new app every few years or so. But, TikTok has introduced a new trend that was unheard of before. The content creation angle of it all has empowered everyone to show their skills to the world and entertain all the users on every platform.

What makes social media so powerful is the integration. Users are on so many different apps that it feels like an entirely different virtual universe. To cope with all that, Influencers need to create impactful content that reaches the maximum number of people.

An excellent way to do that is social media integration. A single media file can be shared on multiple platforms to ensure a good reach, which will boost your followers. For example, if you share a TikTok to Facebook, anyone you aren't on TikTok can enjoy it too. With a well-integrated social media presence, your followers will grow over the years.

If you are new to content creation, this article will show you how you can share TikTok to Facebook stories or news feeds.
