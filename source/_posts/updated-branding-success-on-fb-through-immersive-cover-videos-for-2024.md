Cover videos have been a tactic to allure new customers into the offered product or service. To ensure that the developed video is of the highest of qualities, you need to look into the specifications of a basic or **animated Facebook cover,** as shown below.

### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

### Dimensions to Be Followed

Facebook has set a particular set of dimensions for a **Facebook banner video** that you create for your page or business. With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels. Facebook resizes your video within the 16:9 aspect ratio when uploaded across the platform.

![dimension for facebook cover video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-2.jpg)

It is highly advised that the dimensions set by Facebook should be followed for the best results. However, the Facebook mobile application has something else to say about the size of a cover video. The application cuts off the sides of the video and restricts the display to 640 x 360 pixels. To counter the issue regarding cutting off the sides of the video, users are highly advised to keep their text-centered throughout the video.

## Part 2: How to Set Up Your First Facebook Cover Video

Once you are made aware of all the important aspects of what makes a **Facebook header video** or an **animated Facebook cover,** it is time to take the responsibility of setting up the first Facebook cover video for your business. This part would feature the basic possibilities and procedural requirements to help users set up the first Facebook cover video.

* Make the most unique and exceptional idea out of an advert for your business's cover video. While understanding the professional approach to a Facebook cover video, design a cover video within the border of ethics and morality. Make it fun to watch; however, do not drag the basic idea elsewhere.
* The video that is uploaded across the platform should ensure that the starting and ending points of the video should end within a natural loop. With an auto playset for everyone to view, a Facebook cover video should be uploaded for the audience to see the latest update that you have related to your business.

* The file sizes and specifications are to be followed to their root to gain the best results. Users who complain of not fitting their Facebook cover video to perfection are advised to go through the specifications before finalizing the video. However, it still fails to deliver; try to contact Facebook support over this concern.
* Make sure that the sound of the **Facebook banner video** is turned on.
