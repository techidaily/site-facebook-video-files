Facebook tries to come up with a middle-way solution for its users, providing them effective results over the issues such as the copyright action. If you are still confident in posting the content, Facebook requires some confirmation or other possibilities to help you publish the content.

On the other hand, if it seems impossible to get to a solution over the ownership rights of the content, users are advised to connect with the owner to resolve the issue directly. Since the notification mentions the content owner who filed for copyright actions, you can easily get in touch with the person to resolve the issue. You can also consider appealing the removal of your content for gaining appropriate reasons over its removal.

The information that is received by the user containing the details of the applicant filing for copyright action is provided as follows:

* Report number and owner's name.
* Email address of the reporting party.
* Details of the report and instructions to be followed, if any.
* Guide to submit an appeal

### What Happens Over Repeating Infringement

Facebook has a no-tolerance policy for users who repeatedly breach the copyright of other users' content. Under such circumstances, the platform considers disabling the account or the page is run, if any. While abiding by the rules, Facebook either restricts your posting across the platform or completely disables the account, mostly based on the extent of the infringement.

### How Does a Copyright Report Proceed?

This information is useful for users who report **Facebook video copyright** breaches of their content over someone's post. Facebook receives the email and provides you with the particular number that would act as the identification of the 'ticket' created. Once done, Facebook looks into the issue and notifies the person that has breached the copyrights.

However, under some circumstances, Facebook demands some questions for the person submitting the report, intending to know more about the case if not clarified. Once clear, clear action is taken by the authorities, with proper notifications sent to the user explaining the updates of the report.

## Part 3: Tips to Make Sure that Posted Content Does Not Violate Copyright Law

This part provides users with some tips to prevent them from facing copyright infringement allegations. While being across Facebook, users need to follow a set of tips that would explain how to protect themselves from violating copyright law. There are a few things that a user needs to prevent using across their posts. While focusing on these points, users would be more in control of their content.

* Refrain from using bought or downloaded content from websites, such as iTunes.
* Content that has been recorded across personal recording devices.
* Try to give credit to the owner of the content.
* Add a disclaimer that would clear the intention of using copyright content or infringing it.
* Do not intend to profit from the content.
* Try to add original content in major proportion across your content.
* Do not think that the posted content is of fair use.
