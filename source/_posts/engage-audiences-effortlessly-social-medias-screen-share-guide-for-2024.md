## Part 3\. Share Facebook Live Screen on Desktop

It can be easier to stream live from your desktop. Just remember to use a wired connection to secure your internet. This can help keep your stream live without any interruptions. You can kick back and watch Facebook live with friends. If you're the one creating the stream, then let's go. Let's look at how we can share Facebook live screen on desktop.

**Step 1:** Log in to Facebook using your credentials. Once you're logged in, go to the home page. On the home page, look for the 'Create Posts' option. You can see the option to create 'Live,' 'Event,' 'Jobs,' and more underneath this.

![Create live for live broadcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-9.png)

**Step 2:** Choose 'live video' from that list of options. This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to 'Go Live.' Alternatively, you can also choose to 'Create live video events.' Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.

![choose to go live or schedule an event](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-10.png)

**Step 3:** You can choose to 'Go Live.' This means you can simply go live for a casual update. It comes with the ability to add interactivity tools for your Facebook audience. You can preview how your live stream is going to look. This is done by using the 'Create a test broadcast before going live' button. Toggle it on and click on 'Select.'
