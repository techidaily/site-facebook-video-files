Note: Before we share the steps that you need to follow, please keep in mind that you can only share clickable links on your Facebook story if you have a Facebook page and not through your personal account. So, the steps that we are going to share here will be for people with Facebook pages. Now, follow the following steps:

**Step 1:** Open Facebook and log in. Now, open the Facebook page. Click on the + icon on the profile picture of that Facebook page. Once done, you will see the option to create a story. Please click on that.

![create Facebook Page story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-story-on-facebook-page.jpg)

**Step 2:** You need to type the website name and, on the top, you will see the link icon. Once you are ready with the website name, click on the link icon. Now can choose some buttons based on what kind of link you have shared. For example, shop now, book now, call now, and so on.
