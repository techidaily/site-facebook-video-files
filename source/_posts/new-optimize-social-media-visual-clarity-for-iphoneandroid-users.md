Even if you play a video of 1080p resolution, Facebook controls the display settings. It is because the high-quality videos take longer to load. The display settings are tailored to low quality to be played without facing the buffering issue. It makes the video blurry.

### Video Compression

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**

### Internet Instability

The Facebook videos offer good quality content depending upon the internet connection. The faster connection means the high-quality videos load quicker. Therefore, do check your connection if your concern is **why are my uploaded Facebook videos blurry.**

### Limited Space on Device

Another significant cause of **Facebook videos' blurry Android** is the storage space in the device. If your device offers limited memory, the videos appear pixelated, blurry, and scrambled.

### Method 2: Don't Share the Video Before Uploading

### Method 3: Using Facebook's Camera

**Step 2:** Click on it and find Facebook in the list. Tap "Update" afterward. The updating will begin and conclude in a couple of minutes.
