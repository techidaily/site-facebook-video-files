### Method 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration

Browsers use hardware acceleration to bring the perfect user experience for videos preview. However, it doesn't work all the time, so disabling it feels like the right choice. To disable the hardware acceleration, go to the "Settings" from your system and head to the "Advanced" section. Toggle off "Use hardware acceleration when available."

![disable hardware acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-not-playing-12.jpg)

### Method 4: Download and Watch the Video

If none of the above methods work, you can download the video and watch it later. The Facebook video can be downloaded from online video downloaders accessed from any browser.

### Method 5: Update the Browser to the Latest Version

The Facebook videos stop playing due to the outdated browsers. The users are always recommended to log in to Facebook with a browser that is up to date. Download the latest version of your browser in use and steer clear of **Facebook video not playing continuously.**

### Method 6: Clear the Cache of Your Browser

To clear cache, go to the "Settings" from your browser by clicking on three dots located in the right corner. Hit "Privacy and Security" from there.

Click on "Clear Browsing Data" and tick mark "Cached images and files." Tap "Clear Data" afterward.
