Downloading online videos from social media platforms has always been a hassle. Still, it has now been made easier with the introduction of built-in downloaders and online messenger video downloaders. Videos sent from the sender's local storage are relatively easier to download, but a shared or streaming video from Facebook can be a hassle to save.

Continuing to read below will lead you to many potential solutions that will help you download videos from Facebook Messenger and save them on your device.

## Save Messenger Videos on Windows and Mac

There are several times when you watch a video on Facebook, or someone has sent it to you on Facebook Messenger you want to keep it with you forever on your device, or it is something you don't want to keep online for safety measures so you can download it and then delete it from Facebook Messenger.

### Save Messenger Videos on Windows

Follow the following steps to download videos from Facebook Messenger using a Windows computer.

**Step 1: Open Messenger**

Open the Messenger Application if you have an operating system above Windows 8, or just do it from your browser.

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat with the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Windows PC.

### Save Messenger Videos on Mac

Following are the steps to save Messenger Videos on a Mac. Although the steps are quite similar to those used in a Windows PC, some things may vary due to the different operating systems.

**Step 1: Open Messenger**

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.

Sometimes, the in-built download option is unavailable in some updates or under some circumstances, or the video is not directly from the sender's phone. You may need some tricks on your web browser to do the job.

Following are the steps to do so.

### Step 1: Log in
