## Part 3: How to Add Link to Facebook Story Using WhatsApp?

Facebook acquired WhatsApp in February 2014, and since both the apps are connected with each other, you can easily cross-post your WhatsApp status on the Facebook Story page. WhatsApp status feature is the same as Facebook story. It stays for 24 hours.

**Step 1:** Open your WhatsApp app on your smartphone or tab, whichever you are using.

**Step 2:** Please, click on the Status tab, which will be right beside the Chats tab. Once you are there, you will see the My Status option with a + icon. You need to click on that.

## Part 5: How to Add A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story?

Facebook stories offer another feature, which is known as the Swipe Up Link. On some pages, you might have seen that their stories ask you to Swipe Up, and once you do that, you get redirected to a website. This fantastic feature is available for Facebook pages with a good number of followers and many likes. Else, the swipe-up link feature is available for people with the Blue tick, which means celebrities, brands, and famous people. Here’s how to add a swipe-up link to your Facebook story.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Facebook account and go to your Facebook page to add the swipe-up link.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the + icon that you can see on the profile picture. After that, you need to click on the Create Story option.
