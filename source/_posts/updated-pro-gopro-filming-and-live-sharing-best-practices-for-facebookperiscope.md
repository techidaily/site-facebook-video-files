## Preparation for live streaming

Before you start live streaming from your action camera you will be required to install three apps- the GoPro App, the Live4 App and the Periscope App.

[The GoPro App](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/gopro-app/id561350520?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-will allow you to control your cam, watch the photos and videos and share them on the move.
[The Live4 App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/live4-live-stream-gopro-iphone/id919921242?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-would allow you to broadcast the action sports videos from your GoPro or iPhone.
[The Periscope App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/periscope-live-video-streaming-around-the-world/id972909677?mt=8)\-would allow you to broadcast and view what’s happening around the globe through live clips.

Once you have downloaded these 3 apps you will be required to go to your GoPro app and connect it to your action camera.

1\. Now you have to choose the device with which you want to connect the app.
