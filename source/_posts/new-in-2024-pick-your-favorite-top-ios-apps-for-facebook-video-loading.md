![video downloader for facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-downloader-for-facebook.jpg)

As for one of the best Facebook video downloaders for iPhone, Video Downloader for Facebook assists users in enjoying their favorite videos on iOS devices with ease. Note that the free version of this application does not save videos to the device. They are kept in a library maintained by this tool itself. In case you want to get videos on your device, then it is essential to spend on the Pro version of the Video Downloader app. With this paid version, you will be able to watch videos without annoying ads, and the resolution can be maintained to HD level.

Simply follow the steps below to download Facebook videos on iPad or iPhone:

* First of all, you need to get the Video Downloader software tool from the App store.
* Now launch the app.

![install prenesi to download facebook video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-prenesi-cydia-tweak.jpg)

It is now possible to get Facebook videos directly downloaded on the iPad, iPhone, or iPod using Cydia Prenesi as a jailbreak tweak.

Thus if you are interested in getting your favorite Facebook videos on your personal device, then it is good to get one additional file manager like FileMaster on your device. Generally when you hit the download button on this platform then it just starts playing your video and never reflects any download option on the screen. But in case you use File Master’s web browser instead of common browsers like Safari or Chrome then the process can be visualized on screen. You can easily download FileMaster from the app store without spending your hard-earned money whereas an in-app purchase can further help you to get rid of annoying ads.

* Now visit your browser to open an online Facebook Video Downloader like fbdown.net etc.
* Now paste this copied link at a specified location, choose your file format and click on the Download button.
* As soon as your video downloading process gets finished then visit the Downloads folder to get your video. Select your video to enjoy it in offline mode.

#### 5\.  My Media
