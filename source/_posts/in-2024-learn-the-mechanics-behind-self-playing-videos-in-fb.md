## Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay

Facebook believes in efficiency and human-friendliness. The platform provides features of different contexts driven by efficiency and human-friendliness. While allowing users to add videos to Facebook with its proficient tools under a few restrictions, Facebook also believes in making things simpler for its viewers. For this, the **Facebook autoplay** feature plays a pivotal role in providing ease to the viewers in going through videos.

The autoplay feature on Facebook explains as the tool that automatically plays the video for the users across the page it appears. Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load. Autoplay provides many benefits to its users in multiple ways. From getting a teaser of the video before watching it in its entirety to making your scrolling efficient, **Facebook video autoplay** has proved to be quite effective.

While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements. When using the Autoplay feature on Facebook, users can set four different options according to their discretion. To make the tool effective, you can set it up across mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, you can turn towards the Wi-Fi-only option to save the internet.

The autoplay feature is not a mandatory option for users to manage. This feature can be easily turned off, giving people control over what and what not to play. On the other hand, using **autoplay on Facebook** also provides users with playing the video with sound. However, this is completely under the hands of the user, who select the best option according to their requirements.
