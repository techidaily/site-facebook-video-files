How many of you have observed that you are more glued to viewing videos on Facebook or other social media platforms than before?

A video, without question, is more effective in capturing the audience's attention. Downloading videos from Facebook can help you save recipes, how-to manuals to fixing software glitches, or a funny video to cheer you up.

The above-mentioned Facebook video downloaders function by link and can be downloaded online directly to your devices. Some even boast direct conversion to mp3, which saves you time looking for your favorite songs.
