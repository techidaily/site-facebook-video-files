### 5\. Video Analytics

 Now, the video tab gives you a complete overview of how your videos are performing. You can check out the paid and organic, repeat and unique, and manual click and auto click views on your videos. There are 3 tabs under this section.

 Video views show the number of times your video is viewed and more than 3 seconds is considered a view by Facebook.

 You may check out how many times the people viewed your video for more than 10 seconds under the 10-Second Views tab.

 The Top Videos section shows you the top 5 videos posted by you with more than 3 seconds views. This helps you to analyse the type of video preferred by your audiences.
