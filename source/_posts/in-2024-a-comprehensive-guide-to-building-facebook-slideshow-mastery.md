## Part 4: 5 Tips for Making Facebook Slideshow

After you know how to make slideshow in 3 different ways, here we will let you know 5 tips for making a photo slideshow on Facebook. You can make slideshow now, but if you want to make high quality video slideshow, these tips are necessary and easy to follow and understand.

### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

![Facebook slideshow format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora-business/Facebook-slideshow-format.jpg)

### 3\. Edit your Facebook slideshow

The slideshow will be boring if you only add images to combine it. It is suggested to [add text/title to make your key message appear](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

### 4\. Don't add too many CTAs

We know that you want to do more conversions and get more sales, but if you add CTA on each imgaes, it is a mistake. People will close your slideshow video. [You need to add CTAs wisely](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/seven-principles-for-video-ctas).

### 5\. Rememeber to make test

You won't know which version is better if you don't make A/B test. You can run 2 ads in one campaign to see which ad is better. You need to make sure the budget, bid and landing page are the same of the 2 ads. After the test is over, analyze it and choose the best one for you.

## Part 4: 5 Tips for Making Facebook Slideshow

After you know how to make slideshow in 3 different ways, here we will let you know 5 tips for making a photo slideshow on Facebook. You can make slideshow now, but if you want to make high quality video slideshow, these tips are necessary and easy to follow and understand.

### 1\. Make sure to use 3-10 images

If your have only 2 images, the slideshow are too short to let people know your brand or product. Let's say you have 10 images and one second per image. Then you can get a 10-second slideshow. 10 seconds are enough to [grab people's attention](https://animoto.com/blog/photography/hook-video-viewers-5-seconds/). However, you need to make sure the first 3 seconds are high quality images that people want to continue watching. It is best to add music to make it engaging.

### 2\. Choose the right Facebook slideshow format

It is suggested to use mov and mp4 video format. These 2 formats are compatible well on different devices and the file size won't too large. If you upload Facebook slideshow on other formats, the final file might be too heavy. As a result, the video slideshow will be slower when it is playing.

### 3\. Edit your Facebook slideshow

The slideshow will be boring if you only add images to combine it. It is suggested to [add text/title to make your key message appear](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Most importantly, you can add transitions to make slideshow look natural. If you are good at editing, you also can correct color or make color grading.

### 4\. Don't add too many CTAs

We know that you want to do more conversions and get more sales, but if you add CTA on each imgaes, it is a mistake. People will close your slideshow video. [You need to add CTAs wisely](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/seven-principles-for-video-ctas).

### 5\. Rememeber to make test

You won't know which version is better if you don't make A/B test. You can run 2 ads in one campaign to see which ad is better. You need to make sure the budget, bid and landing page are the same of the 2 ads. After the test is over, analyze it and choose the best one for you.
