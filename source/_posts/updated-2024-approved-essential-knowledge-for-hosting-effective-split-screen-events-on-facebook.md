![split screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-in-filmora.jpg)

You will find the Split Screen button on Wondershare Toolbar. Select this option and it will soon lead you to the library containing numbers of split-screen formats. Out of this big list, you can choose anyone and then drag it to a timeline.

One more option is to choose your present type and then hit the Plus icon available on the lower right portion of the thumbnail.

#### Step 4. Add videos to Split Screen

Go to the timeline and double click on your recently selected preset. You will find drop zones on your timeline to which videos can be added. Simply drag your video files and drop them in different drop zones as the available one box contains a slider for time adjustments of various videos, users can access it to apply desired timing constraints.

![split screen drop zone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-drop-zone.jpg)

#### Step 5. Video Sound Adjustment

Now as you have added all videos to your split screen, they will naturally start playing at the same time and their audio information will appear like noise. Here you need to apply some trick for sound adjustment so that viewers do not find your content annoying. The best advice is to mute one video at a time and let another play normally. In order to mute a video file, you can simply hit the Mute Track option from Drop Zone. Users can also mute both these videos and add one separate informative file in form of a soundtrack to the split-screen video. You can find such soundtrack files in the built-in media library of Wondershare. Once all soundtrack adjustments are done then hit the OK button to save the changes.
