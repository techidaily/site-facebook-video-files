## Part 2: How to Add Clickable Link in Facebook Story Using Facebook App?

Note: Before we share the steps that you need to follow, please keep in mind that you can only share clickable links on your Facebook story if you have a Facebook page and not through your personal account. So, the steps that we are going to share here will be for people with Facebook pages. Now, follow the following steps:

**Step 1:** Open Facebook and log in. Now, open the Facebook page. Click on the + icon on the profile picture of that Facebook page. Once done, you will see the option to create a story. Please click on that.

**Step 2:** You need to type the website name and, on the top, you will see the link icon. Once you are ready with the website name, click on the link icon. Now can choose some buttons based on what kind of link you have shared. For example, shop now, book now, call now, and so on.

## Part 3: How to Add Link to Facebook Story Using WhatsApp?

**Step 1:** Open your WhatsApp app on your smartphone or tab, whichever you are using.

**Step 2:** Please, click on the Status tab, which will be right beside the Chats tab. Once you are there, you will see the My Status option with a + icon. You need to click on that.

## Part 5: How to Add A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story?

Facebook stories offer another feature, which is known as the Swipe Up Link. On some pages, you might have seen that their stories ask you to Swipe Up, and once you do that, you get redirected to a website. This fantastic feature is available for Facebook pages with a good number of followers and many likes. Else, the swipe-up link feature is available for people with the Blue tick, which means celebrities, brands, and famous people. Here’s how to add a swipe-up link to your Facebook story.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Facebook account and go to your Facebook page to add the swipe-up link.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the + icon that you can see on the profile picture. After that, you need to click on the Create Story option.
