**Pre-Roll Ads**

Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.

Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.

**Image Ads**

Some ads are displayed under the content. These ads are static and are known as Image Ads. These types of ads work best for videos that cannot adjust mid-roll ads.

**Post-Roll Ads**

Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.
