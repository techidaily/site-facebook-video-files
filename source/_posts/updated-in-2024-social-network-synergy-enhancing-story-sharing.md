**Step 1:** Open your WhatsApp app on your smartphone or tab, whichever you are using.

**Step 2:** Please, click on the Status tab, which will be right beside the Chats tab. Once you are there, you will see the My Status option with a + icon. You need to click on that.

## Part 5: How to Add A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story?

Facebook stories offer another feature, which is known as the Swipe Up Link. On some pages, you might have seen that their stories ask you to Swipe Up, and once you do that, you get redirected to a website.
