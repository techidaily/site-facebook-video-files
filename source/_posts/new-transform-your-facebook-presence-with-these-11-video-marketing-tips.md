### 10\. Add call to action

Adding a call to action in your video is vital. Without a call to action, viewers might watch and forget a video and the message you are conveying will be lost.

You need to build the base, ask them to like, share, or comment on your Facebook videos or even push them gently to visit your website, check out the products/service. You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.
