### **Enable Facebook Security Features**

Facebook has improved security options. Turn on two - factor authentication, trusted contacts, security questions, recovery emails, personal identity. Update all the security features as they come in handy while recovering the account.

Obviously, it becomes vital to protect your Facebook data if you're a content creator and uploads videos. Facebook is a popular method of displaying creativity through video editing and talent. It can be dancing musical, nature, festive videos, or any type of editing.
