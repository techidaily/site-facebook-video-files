First if all, you need to add your video file to Wondershare Filmora timeline. Note that it is good to import videos to Media Library first and then access them for editing via library only so that your original video files can stay safe. Use drag and drop feature or Add files option to get your files from Media Library to Timeline.

#### Step 2: Apply Template

Wondershare Filmora will provide you a wide range of templates for selection of text formats. You can pick any of these as per need.

* **Add Titles:**When you are ready to add titles to your Facebook videos, then simply move to Text/Credit Tab on your software tool, here you will find more than 90 text templates. Choose any of these as per your need and finally drag it to title track available on timeline. Soon you will find a text thumbnail on screen with a letter T. Open text editor panel by double clicking on this text thumbnail and now you can start typing you’re your titles. Make selections for animation, color and font type.
* **Add Subtitles/ End /Opener Credit:**The process for adding subtitles or credits is almost same as that of titles editing. All that you need to do is, drag and drop your desired template from Credit tab to timeline, place this template on your selected video file. Now enter your text based information and make selections for desired animation, color and font type. In case if you are working on Photos then you can also access various built in type editing tools like Motion, Hue, Saturation, Contrast, Brightness, Crop and Rotate etc.

#### Step 3: Export edited file and Save

Once you have finished the text based editing task then hit the Export option available on software window. It will provide you six different output selection options, edited file can be send to DVD, Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook, Device and one can adjust desired Format for it. If you want to update this edited file on Facebook Page then simply select MP3 as your desired output file format.
