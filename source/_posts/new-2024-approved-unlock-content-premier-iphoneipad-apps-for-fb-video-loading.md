But in case you use File Master’s web browser instead of common browsers like Safari or Chrome then the process can be visualized on screen.

* Go to your Facebook account and search for your favorite video that you want to download. Once you get it then copy the URL of this particular video from the top bar.
* Now visit your browser to open an online Facebook Video Downloader like fbdown.net etc.
* Now paste this copied link at a specified location, choose your file format and click on the Download button.
* As soon as your video downloading process gets finished then visit the Downloads folder to get your video. Select your video to enjoy it in offline mode.
