The method for live streaming from Xbox to Facebook is fairly simple: all you need to do is stream the content of your Xbox to your computer by making use of a capture card. In case you don’t have a capture card you need to download one of those special software. Now you need to make use of a 3rd party app like Wirecast or Obs in order to live stream the screen of your desktop onto Facebook.

After living streaming videos to Facebook, you may want to [analyze the data of video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to attract more likes.

**Step 1: The first thing you have to do is enable the setting on your Xbox.**

a. For this you need to go to the settings of your Xbox and then choose Preferences. Now click on the box where it says “Allow game streaming to other devices”.

**Step 2: Connect the Xbox one to the Windows 10 computer**

b. Now go to the panel on the left hand side and click on **‘connect’**.

c. Your home network is going to be scanned by the Xbox software for any Xbox console present. Select the name of the console with which you would like to connect. Ensure that the console and the Windows pc are on one network.
