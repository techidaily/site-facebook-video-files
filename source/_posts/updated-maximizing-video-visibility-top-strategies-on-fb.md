Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.

Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.

### 4\. Shoot Facebook video vertically

A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile. Portrait (vertically-aligned) videos have a better hit rate compared to horizontal shots. Keeping that in mind, make sure to create your new videos in a mobile friendly manner.

### 5\. Feature a Video on Facebook Page

Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.

It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.

You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.

### 6\. Carefully choose thumbnail

Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.

When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.

### 8\. Mobile friendly

Being the perfect partner to kill time, while waiting for someone, travelling alone, or in the queue in a supermarket, mobile phones certainly have more attention than other gadgets.

So, Facebook marketing videos need to cash on this aspect. These videos need to be mobile-friendly, means they have to be short and aligned to fit any mobile screen size without pixellating. Adverts that scored high for mobiles have the following aspects –

* Easy to understandable message, even without any audio.
* Most part of the video concentrates on the product or service.
* The visuals identify the brand clearly

### 9\. Posting time is important

Knowing the right time to post your social media video on Facebook or any other social media platform is vital.

People from diverse backgrounds or field of work consume different video content. You might have heard that Wednesdays are great for business related videos.

There are tools to study the statistics and analyze the most favorable time for posting your Facebook marketing video. You can use them to determine what’s your time to post and get more viewership.

### 10\. Add call to action

Adding a call to action in your video is vital. Without a call to action, viewers might watch and forget a video and the message you are conveying will be lost.

You need to build the base, ask them to like, share, or comment on your Facebook videos or even push them gently to visit your website, check out the products/service. You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.
