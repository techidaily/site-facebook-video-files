## 2\. Messenger Day – The Snapchat Way

 This app was also launched in the month of March and surprisingly it appeared like biggest competitor against Instagram Stories and Snapchat. However, few features like stickers, filters and posts disappearing within 24 hours etc are also same as that of other competing platforms.

 You can find Messenger Day feature directly in already existing Facebook Messenger and it will help you to check people that are active for real time chats. Reviews about Messenger Day reveal that this tool boosts thought sharing on social media platform. Users can easily share about what they are doing or what are their plans ahead. For example if you have having coffee at your favourite restaurant and want to tell your friends about it then you simply need to capture a selfie, put a sticker on it and simple transfer it to your friend.

 One more interesting thing to know about this recent update to Facebook is that it now contains so many interactive filters that users can easily apply to their photos to impress the audience. If you are a biased Snapchat user then this feature can help you to move to Facebook app soon.

## 3\. Facebook Live

But now it is possible to start broadcasting directly from your Laptop or Personal desktop computer using Facebook Live Feature. Further, Admins can also tag others as Live Contributors during streaming process on pages. You can also add comments to live broadcasts which were not possible earlier.
