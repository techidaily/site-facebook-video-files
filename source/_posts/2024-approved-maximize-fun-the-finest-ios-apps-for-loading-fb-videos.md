As for one of the best Facebook video downloaders for iPhone, Video Downloader for Facebook assists users in enjoying their favorite videos on iOS devices with ease. Note that the free version of this application does not save videos to the device. They are kept in a library maintained by this tool itself. In case you want to get videos on your device, then it is essential to spend on the Pro version of the Video Downloader app. With this paid version, you will be able to watch videos without annoying ads, and the resolution can be maintained to HD level.
