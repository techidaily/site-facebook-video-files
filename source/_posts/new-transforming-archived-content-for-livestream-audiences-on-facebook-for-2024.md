### LiveReacting

[LiveReacting](https://www.livereacting.com/) is a cloud-based tool that helps you to upload pre-recorded videos to Facebook Live.

Here's how you can use the platform for streaming pre-recorded video live on Facebook:

![livereacting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/pre-recorded-video-live-on-facebook-3.jpeg)

* Modify the streaming settings by choosing the social account where you want to go live on. Mention the title, description, adjust stream duration, and schedule any automatic uploads if you want to.
* After making the adjustments, click on "Go Live". This will broadcast your video in 5-4 seconds.

### Open Broadcaster Software

It's an outstanding open-source platform that ensures efficient screencasting, recording, and Live streaming. Live videos get more viral than conventional videos. Thus, its popularity is obligatory.

Start by launching the Stream key to enable the use of streaming software. Do not disclose the Stream Key to anyone as it may be misused. The validity of the Stream key is around seven days.

* The "+" icon allows you to add multiple videos. Make sure to do so if you want to feature a list of videos. Once done, click on the Ok button and mute the Mic/Aux. Now, click on the Start Streaming button.
* Navigate to the Facebook window and click on the "Go live" button.
