First if all, you need to add your video file to Wondershare Filmora timeline.

Use drag and drop feature or Add files option to get your files from Media Library to Timeline.

#### Step 2: Apply Template

Open text editor panel by double clicking on this text thumbnail and now you can start typing you’re your titles. Make selections for animation, color and font type.
* **Add Subtitles/ End /Opener Credit:**The process for adding subtitles or credits is almost same as that of titles editing. All that you need to do is, drag and drop your desired template from Credit tab to timeline, place this template on your selected video file. Now enter your text based information and make selections for desired animation, color and font type. In case if you are working on Photos then you can also access various built in type editing tools like Motion, Hue, Saturation, Contrast, Brightness, Crop and Rotate etc.
