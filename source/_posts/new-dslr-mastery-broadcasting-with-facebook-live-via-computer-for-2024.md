## Live Stream DSLR to Facebook by Broadcasting Softwares

 xSplit, Wirecast and OBS- all three software tools that have a big competition in market. If you are new to live streaming world and now want to select right software tool for your live streaming needs then it is good to read detailed comparison between Wirecast, xSplit and OBS:

### 1. OBS

OBS or Open Broadcaster Software tool offers huge collection of editing tools with feature rich options to develop customized videos.

**Pros:**

* OBS is an open source tool available for free.
* Offers solid screen switching facility.
* Considered as a global source.
**Cons**
* Lower encoding quality.
* Difficult to develop scenes.

### 2\. XSplit:

 XSplit can handle big collection of data with ease that is why professionals prefer to use this tool for their streaming productions, digital training courses and for managing video podcasts.

**Pros:**

* It is much easier to operate with extremely solid user platform.
* Offers lots of advanced features along with additional plug-ins.
* OBS assists in skype interactions.
**Cons**

The fact is the when sensor of a DSLR camera stays ON for long time, it suffers huge damage. Open shutter leads to potential harm to your camera. It is good to use DSLR for short while but if you are a beginner and need a device to begin with then prefer to pick right webcam for your needs.
