Whenever a person searches for you on the internet the first thing s/he is going to see is your Facebook profile.

It goes without saying that your profile picture and the cover picture are of primary importance when it comes to your social media presence. Your profile picture has a great deal to say about you- about the person you are and about the mood you are in at any given time. These days the Facebook profile video option has given us the chance to create a stunning impression. However, not all of us knows how to create a superb impression of ourselves through Facebook profile video.

 Note: It needs to be noted here that you will be able to zoom in and zoom out the timeline so as to view all the clips in the timeline with clarity. In case the duration of the video is lengthy then you can alter the duration of the still photos or cut some of the clips from the video footage. In order to use other effects like overlays and filters you just need to depend on Filmora.

#### 3\. Saving your video to the device

 Once you are done with the editing of your footage you need to hit the Export button for output. Since the Facebook profile video can only be uploaded through an iOS or Android smartphone, you will be required to select the Device in the left panel of the Export Window and then choose your device.
