As for one of the best Facebook video downloaders for iPhone, Video Downloader for Facebook assists users in enjoying their favorite videos on iOS devices with ease. Note that the free version of this application does not save videos to the device. They are kept in a library maintained by this tool itself.

But in case you use File Master’s web browser instead of common browsers like Safari or Chrome then the process can be visualized on screen.

* Launch the application and then hit the web browser option.
* Go to your Facebook account and search for your favorite video that you want to download. Once you get it then copy the URL of this particular video from the top bar.
* Now visit your browser to open an online Facebook Video Downloader like fbdown.net etc.
* Now paste this copied link at a specified location, choose your file format and click on the Download button.
* As soon as your video downloading process gets finished then visit the Downloads folder to get your video. Select your video to enjoy it in offline mode.
