1\. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.

Tips:

Facebook and other social media platforms have different limitations on how large GIFs can be uploaded, so keep the GIF file size at 5MB or under that.

But if you don’t know how to download GIF from Facebook it can be a bit disappointing not being able to share the GIF meme you loved.
