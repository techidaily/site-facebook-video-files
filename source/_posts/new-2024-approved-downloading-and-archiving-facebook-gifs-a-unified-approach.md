## Part 1: Download GIF from Facebook on PC

GIFs are an ideal quick-loading, colorful, and animated visual communication medium. An excellent approach of visual interaction designed previously for slow and limited internet connections now has evolved into a robust and vivid instant communication channel in the world of social media. Happiness makes us want to share, and sadness helps us connect, and GIFs give our emotions the striking visual flair for instant sharing on social media.

Often you love a GIF on Facebook but are not able to share it with your friends because you could not download it on your PC. To help you easily share your emotions on the social world, and download Facebook GIF, follow the steps below.

1\. Downloading GIFs from Facebook on the PC or a Mac system is a pretty simple and straightforward process. Open the Facebook website on your browser and go to the GIF you want to download.

## Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone

Apple has put a tight grip on the things a user can perform on their devices, that’s why iPhone users are not allowed to download videos and images directly from the internet on to the internal storage of the device. Downloading GIFs from Facebook and saving it onto your iPhone will require you to follow the steps exactly as I mention down here.

1\. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.

2\. Now head over to the GIF you want to download.

![head over gif on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-over-gif5.jpg)

3\. Press the link to open the GIF in the browser.

4\. Facebook will open the GIF in the internal browser window, where you will see the three-dotted menu icon at the top right corner.

The GIF image will be downloaded on your iPhone and saved into the Camera Roll. Now you can easily share the GIF with anyone you like, head over to the GIF image in the Camera Roll, and press the share button on the image to select the app on which you want to share the GIF.

Tips:

Facebook and other social media platforms have different limitations on how large GIFs can be uploaded, so keep the GIF file size at 5MB or under that.

## Conclusion

GIFs allow people to express their emotions where words lag. In the age of social media, you often come across GIFs on Facebook and would love to share it with friends on other platforms directly. But if you don’t know how to download GIF from Facebook it can be a bit disappointing not being able to share the GIF meme you loved.
