 xSplit, Wirecast and OBS- all three software tools that have a big competition in market. If you are new to live streaming world and now want to select right software tool for your live streaming needs then it is good to read detailed comparison between Wirecast, xSplit and OBS:

### 1. OBS

OBS or Open Broadcaster Software tool offers huge collection of editing tools with feature rich options to develop customized videos.

**Pros:**

* OBS is an open source tool available for free.
* Offers solid screen switching facility.
* Considered as a global source.
**Cons**

### 2\. XSplit:
