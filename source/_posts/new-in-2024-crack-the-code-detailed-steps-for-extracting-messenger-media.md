Downloading online videos from social media platforms has always been a hassle. Still, it has now been made easier with the introduction of built-in downloaders and online messenger video downloaders. Videos sent from the sender's local storage are relatively easier to download, but a shared or streaming video from Facebook can be a hassle to save.

Continuing to read below will lead you to many potential solutions that will help you download videos from Facebook Messenger and save them on your device.

## Save Messenger Videos on Windows and Mac
