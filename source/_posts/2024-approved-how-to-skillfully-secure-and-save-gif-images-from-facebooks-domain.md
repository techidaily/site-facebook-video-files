Facebook and other social media platforms have different limitations on how large GIFs can be uploaded, so keep the GIF file size at 5MB or under that.

## Part 1: Download GIF from Facebook on PC

GIFs are an ideal quick-loading, colorful, and animated visual communication medium. An excellent approach of visual interaction designed previously for slow and limited internet connections now has evolved into a robust and vivid instant communication channel in the world of social media. Happiness makes us want to share, and sadness helps us connect, and GIFs give our emotions the striking visual flair for instant sharing on social media.

Often you love a GIF on Facebook but are not able to share it with your friends because you could not download it on your PC. To help you easily share your emotions on the social world, and download Facebook GIF, follow the steps below.

1\. Downloading GIFs from Facebook on the PC or a Mac system is a pretty simple and straightforward process. Open the Facebook website on your browser and go to the GIF you want to download.

![open gif on facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-gif-on-facebook1.jpg)

2\. Now tap GIF and select to open it in another browser window.

![play gif on a new tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-gif-on-new-tab2.jpg)

3\. You will see the GIF in play mode on the actual site, right-click on the GIF and choose the   **“View Image”** option.

![view the gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-gif3.jpg)

4\. Now you will leave the website and be presented with only the GIF content, right-click the GIF again and you will see the option **“Save Image As”** select the option. It will start downloading the GIF onto your PC.

![save gif to your computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif-as.jpg)

It was this much simple to download Facebook GIF onto your PC and share it with your friends on the go.

Downloading Facebook GIF on an Android device is pretty straightforward and only requires you to do it the right way. To get your favorite GIF on your Android device, follow along with the steps below.

1\. Open the Facebook app on your Android phone.

## Part 3:Download GIF from Facebook on iPhone

Apple has put a tight grip on the things a user can perform on their devices, that’s why iPhone users are not allowed to download videos and images directly from the internet on to the internal storage of the device. Downloading GIFs from Facebook and saving it onto your iPhone will require you to follow the steps exactly as I mention down here.

1\. Open the Facebook app on your iPhone.

2\. Now head over to the GIF you want to download.

![head over gif on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-over-gif5.jpg)

4\. Facebook will open the GIF in the internal browser window, where you will see the three-dotted menu icon at the top right corner.
