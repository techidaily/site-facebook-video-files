### Rules and Requirements for Facebook Video Monetization

If you want to monetize your Facebook page, you need to check your eligibility for various programs. Decide on your business goal and determine your Facebook monetization strategy.

It is easy to verify eligibility with Facebook. Click on the Monetization tab in the Creator Studio. Click Apply if you already have a Facebook page. You can check your eligibility for monetization using the Monetization Eligibility Checker. The colors show whether you're eligible, or there are any issues, and whether you're not.

Facebook's Monetization Eligibility Standards include at their most basic level, the following:

* A professional (business) Facebook profile or page that's been active for at least 30 days is preferred.
* Become a paid live event participant by getting 10,000 followers or more.

## Part 2\. The potential of Facebook as an Income Source

Facebook reports that content creators make between $1,000 and $10,000 per month. Facebook Reels, Live, and fan subscriptions are some avenues. You can make a monthly income from Facebook by generating long-form video content and even paid online events. It's possible to earn thousands if you produce content regularly.

There are lots of fun virtual gifts your viewers can attach to the virtual stars they send you. Each star you receive from Facebook is worth $0.01.

### Pay-per-view structure and Facebook payment structure

Ad impressions, video views, and engagement are all factors that determine Facebook's payment structure. Here's a rough calculation of how much Facebook pays per 1,000 views:

**Your earnings = (Ad CPM x ad views)/1,000**

Ad CPM means 'cost per thousand.' This is your Facebook ad cost per 1,000 impressions, based on the content you create, the audience, etc. If you had 10,000 views and the CPM was $4, you would net $40\. By building up a bank of these types of videos, people can earn money on Facebook.

### Facebook followers and views required to earn money

According to Meta, you need 10,000 followers to monetize your Facebook page. Your videos will then be able to run Facebook ads. Getting a large number of followers isn't as challenging as technical requirements like eligibility.

Sharing your page with your friends is one way. To get your posts shared, curate content that you and your target audience will enjoy. The key to maintaining a following is regular engagement with your posts once you've built one. Every industry requires frequent engagement to grow a following.

![facebook ads for facebook monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Monetize-Your-Facebook-Page-Tips-and-Tricks-5.jpg)

#### 3\. Collabo Manager for Brands

Your brand will be more identifiable if you use this rather than in-stream ads. The more authentic your content is, the better your partnership will be. That's great! In order to get paid for creating content with brands, you must:

* Get to know Facebook's policies for monetizing partners and branded content.
* A minimum of 1,000 followers is required.

#### 6\. Make use of affiliate marketing links
